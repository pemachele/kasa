<p>Did you know that college and university both refer to different educational communities or institutions in Canada? Most people use the terms interchangeably as they both refer to education institutions without knowing that they mean different things and have distinct differences. </p>



<p>Simply, colleges focus more on career and technical training and trades. It is specifically designed for students who best learn with individualised attention and have the ability to commit more quickly and directly with teachers. On the other hand, universities concentrate on academic and professional programs. However, both academic institutions can lead you to success.Â  So, what is the difference between college and university in Canada? Let&#8217;s get at it!</p>



<h2><strong>Difference Between College and University in Canada</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>Types of Programs</strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong>College</strong></li></ul>



<p>In Canada, a college is an academic community primarily designed for students who are interested in learning trades, technology, applied arts and desire to have hands-on career training. Basically, colleges tend to offer more career-oriented programs, which usually involves apprenticeship training components. It is mainly designed for employability and is open to fields such as health, tech and business.</p>



<p>A college offers students both full-time and part-time diploma and certificate programs. Meanwhile, one can obtain a Bachelor&#8217;s degree in a college, especially in the applied areas; however, it will all depend on the college you choose to study in.</p>



<ul><li><strong>University</strong></li></ul>



<p>In Canada, universities are academic institutions mainly designed for people looking to study more academic and professional programs to earn degrees upon completing their studies. To study in a university in Canada, you will be required to select a &#8216;major&#8217; to focus on and a &#8216;minor&#8217; area of study. And you will be required to focus more on the former than the latter. These majors are usually in fields such as medicine, dentistry and law.</p>



<p>Generally, these studies are generally focused on analytical skills. There are two different primary degrees you can obtain from universities in Canada:</p>



<p>Undergraduate degrees: this type is generally known as a Bachelor&#8217;s degree.</p>



<p>Graduate degree: this type is known as Masters or Doctorate degree.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center"><p><strong>Read</strong>: <a href="https://mapleeducation.ca/nigeria-student-express-canada/">Everything You Need to Know About the Nigerian Student Express Program</a></p></blockquote>



<h3>Class Size</h3>



<ul><li><strong>College</strong></li></ul>



<p>In Canada, colleges tend to have smaller class sizes. Also, it has a lower student-to-instructor ratio. Usually, the purpose is to help each student get more hands-on practical training, instruction and experience. The smaller, the better!</p>



<ul><li><strong>University</strong></li></ul>



<p>Generally, universities are extensively larger than colleges. This usually reduces the potency for one-on-one help like it is in colleges. A class in a university could consist of over 100 students in a lecture hall. Simply, this means that going to universities means you will be required to be more independent and experience more self-lead works</p>



<h3>Cost</h3>



<ul><li><strong>College</strong></li></ul>



<p>Most colleges in Canada have higher equipment costs than universities in the country. Taking on programs, especially programs such as graphic design, cinematography, video editing and photography, you are bound to incur more costs for laptops, editing software, cameras and a lot of others. This is the same for tech programs that usually require students to have specific virtual machines or laptops.</p>



<ul><li><strong>University</strong></li></ul>



<p>According to <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/190904/t003b-eng.htm">statistics</a> in 2019/2020, the average yearly tuition fees for full-time study in universities in Canada are as follows:</p>



<p>Undergraduate students: $6.463</p>



<p>Graduate students: $7.056.</p>



<p>Basically, tuition costs for both colleges and universities in Canada are comparable. The significant difference is in the duration of programs each of them takes to be completed. Due to that, you are likely to spend more in the university than in colleges in Canada.</p>



<h3>Program Length</h3>



<ul><li><strong>College</strong></li></ul>



<p>A college certificate program in Canada usually takes about one year or less to complete and begin to practice in your chosen field of study. And diploma programs take about two to three years to complete. These programs are usually more intensive than university programs in Canada due to numerous training to enable students to gain hands-on experience in their chosen fields; however, the perk is the duration it takes to complete programs.</p>



<p>In Canada, colleges usually do not allow you the option to carve your own schedule. It will be put together for you to follow.</p>



<p>These programs in colleges usually involve training or internships that allow you to gain hands-on experience by practising with industry professionals in your field of study. Sometimes, these trainings are scheduled within your regular courses and the other times, you will be required to work over the summer.</p>



<ul><li><strong>University</strong></li></ul>



<p>University programs in Canada take about 3-four years to complete. Also, you can complete a graduate program after four years, but the duration will all be dependent on your subject area as some require a duration of up to 10 years to complete.</p>



<p>In Canada, universities allow you to plan your own schedules while you take the time to handle other activities. However, you can fasten your graduation by taking on a full course which consists of taking five courses per semester. If not, the part-time study involves taking three or four courses per semester. If you desire to work and earn while you are in school, then part-time will definitely do it for you.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Read</strong> : <a href="https://mapleeducation.ca/express-entry-canada/">How to Migrate to Canada Through Express Entry</a></p></blockquote>



<h3><strong>Learning Format</strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong>College</strong></li></ul>



<p>In Canada, colleges have a mix of learning formats to enable students to gain real-life experiences and training in their chosen fields. This involved student-led discussions, work practices and interactive classes/lessons. Also, there&#8217;s usually a blend of in-class and online programs offering practical learning opportunities.</p>



<p>There are more online learning opportunities for students in colleges than there are for university students in Canada. Studying in college, you can get to study at your own pace and time even without having to leave your home sometimes.</p>



<ul><li><strong>University</strong></li></ul>



<p>Universities in Canada involved more lecture-based programs with only little opportunity for online courses. A funny but distinct difference in the learning format between the two academic communities could be colleges having classes while lectures are held in universities.</p>



<p>This is because colleges deal with more training and practice while universities involve students listening while the teacher or lecturer lectures. Another fun difference between college and university in Canada is that teachers are referred to as professors in universities in Canada.</p>

<p>A Master&#8217;s degree and Postgraduate diploma are two of the most popular options available for students looking to further their education in Canada after their undergraduate studies. While students know this, not many have a good grasp of how they work and what differentiates them. Most of the resources online focus more on Master&#8217;s Degree and PhD, so the former seems like the only natural step after undergraduate studies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But each student&#8217;s situation and goals call for a different approach, and a postgraduate diploma can also serve a need. It is an option for an individual who doesn&#8217;t want something time-intensive or research-focused. Those whose situation changed halfway through their Master&#8217;s Degree can find a postgraduate diploma helpful. Instead of simply dropping out altogether, they can recourse to a post-graduate diploma. The same thing applies to anyone who finds out halfway through their Master&#8217;s Degree that dissertation isn&#8217;t their thing.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What Is the Difference Between a Postgraduate and Master&#8217;s Degree?</strong></h2>



<p>Below are some of the differences between a Master&#8217;s Degree and a Postgraduate Diploma.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>A Masters Degree is a Longer Qualification</strong></h3>



<p>Though a Masters Degree and a Postgraduate Diploma are on the same academic level, the former is a more extended qualification. When studying full-time, a Masters degree takes one year to complete, the modules worth 180 credits. In contrast, a postgraduate diploma takes two terms, with modules worth 120 credits. <a href="https://www.postgraduatesearch.com/advice/pgdip-pgcert/what-is-a-postgraduate-certificate/ap-63595/%3famp=true">Postgraduate certificates</a> last just one term, with modules worth 60 credits only. Each surpasses the next with modules worth 60 credits.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Postgraduate Diplomas are Vocational</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Postgraduate diplomas are vocational. This means postgraduate diplomas focus on helping students acquire practical skills and specific skills in their chosen field. While a Masters degree involves completing a series of modules and writing a dissertation. You may be better off with a postgraduate diploma if you&#8217;re looking to go into journalism or <a href="https://mapleeducation.ca/study-law-in-canada-for-nigerian-students/">law</a>. Usually, postgraduate diplomas give you access to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-service-commission/jobs/services/recruitment/students/federal-student-work-program.html">work programs</a> that allow you to gain some experience while studying. But if you&#8217;re looking to become a professor or a researcher, a masters degree aligns better with your goals.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>A Master&#8217;s Degree Requires an Undergraduate Degree</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>You can&#8217;t go for a masters degree without having an undergraduate degree or equivalent title. It&#8217;s different with a postgraduate diploma. Some programs grant admission to students without an undergraduate degree as long as they have professional experience in their chosen fields. Additionally, a masters degree can be specific to a university. But all graduate diplomas are always university-specific.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Master&#8217;s Degrees are More Expensive</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Importantly, money is another significant differentiator. A masters degree is quite expensive compared to a postgraduate diploma. Many people find a postgraduate diploma more affordable. Individuals enrolled in a postgraduate diploma can easily take career breaks because of their length. If they wish, postgraduate diploma students can also combine their academic pursuit with their current job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, being research-based, a masters degree allows you to contribute knowledge to the world through your research, insights, and discoveries. In addition, you can pursue further education like a PHD with your Master&#8217;s degree. Your chances of gaining recognition and applause are high. While a postgraduate diploma enables you to acquire a qualification that can quickly enhance your career in any particular field.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Healthcare plan in Ontario</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canadaâs free health care system is one of the country&#8217;s main attractions. The free health care system means you won&#8217;t pay any direct fee before seeing a doctor. Canadaâs tax system funds the no-cost health care system. According to the </span><a href="https://www.cihi.ca/en/health-spending#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20total%20health%20expenditure,gross%20domestic%20product%20(GDP)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to maintain the no-cost health care system, the average person pays about CA$ 7,068 each year. This might seem on the high side for foreigners, but Canadians see it as fair for the quality of health care they&#8217;re getting.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, note that only Canadians and permanent residents have access to Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP). Health care in Canada works differently for foreign nationals. If you&#8217;re moving to Ontario in Canada as a student or non-resident, you would have to budget for a public healthcare plan or University Health Insurance Plan (UHIP).Â </span></p>

<h3>Healthcare costs in Quebec</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medical care is covered by the plan administered by Quebecâs health insurance board (RÃ©gie de lâassurance maladie du QuÃ©bec/RAMQ). It is available across the province of Quebec, and all residents are eligible for the plan. To get it, residents have to register with the RAMQ. Then wait for three months, what&#8217;s known as the waiting period.Â  This plan does not cover treatments like plastic surgery. But it covers other surgeries, vasectomies, urine and blood glucose tests, medical exams, anaesthetic agents, etc.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">International students have options like CEGEPâs Group Health and Hospitalization Insurance Plan. The insurance plan costs CAD 936 and covers dental care, anaesthetic, HIV, Hospital expenses, Renal Dialysis, psychiatry, etc.Â </span></p>
<h2>Is it cheaper to live in Ontario or Quebec?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you choose to move to Ontario or Quebec depends on what&#8217;s most important to you. For instance, you might have family or friends you want to be closer to.Â  Also, it could depend on where your workplace or school is located. Consider your priorities and choose which one has the better benefit in the long run.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada is an immigrant-friendly country, and this shows in its immigration policies. The country offers Nigerians over a hundred economic-class immigration programs to select from. Nigerians who want to move to Canada can leverage this to school, work or gain permanent residence in Canada. In 2019, a </span><a href="https://www.cicnews.com/2020/02/a-quarter-of-canadas-immigrants-arrived-from-india-in-2019-0213700.html#gs.y8vfbr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">whopping thirteen thousand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nigerians obtained permanent residency. This is because Canadaâs economic class programs, and the fact that Nigeria is an English-speaking country, give Nigerians an edge in the application process. Do you ever wonder what it will cost you to relocate to Canada from Nigeria? Keep reading this article to find out.</span></p>
<h2><b>What does it cost to relocate to Canada from Nigeria?</b></h2>
<p>Canada offers opportunities in sectors that appeal to Nigerians and can improve their quality of life. <a href="https://mapleeducation.ca/study-in-canada-from-nigeria/">ICT, oil and gas, health care, and other STEM-related</a> fields are a few among the country&#8217;s established sectors. There are also various pathways available to study, work or live in Canada like the <a href="https://mapleeducation.ca/nigeria-student-express-canada/">Nigeria Student Express program</a> that helps Nigerian students get their student visas faster. And compared to countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, moving to Canada is relatively affordable. But how much exactly does it cost to relocate to Canada from Nigeria?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amount depends on whether you&#8217;re relocating alone or with your family. And unless you have a job waiting for you in Canada, you&#8217;ll need enough money to keep you afloat. At least until you get settled. This is why the Canadian government requires those applying for permanent residence to have a certain amount in their bank account. Your immigration pathway also affects the cost to move to Canada from Nigeria:</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3>Provincial Nomination Programs (PNPs)</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eleven provincial and territorial governments manage PNPs in Canada. Each of these provinces and territories decides its processing or application fees. If you&#8217;re nominated for PNP, the amount you pay for processing will then be added to the cost of your permanent resident application. Getting a PNP nomination boosts your chances of immigration considerably.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The settlement fund for PNP differs by province. To qualify for nomination, you must meet the settlement funds requirement of that particular province. Click onÂ  </span><a href="https://www.aptechvisa.com/ontario-provincial-nominee-program-oinp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ontario</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.aptechvisa.com/sinp-saskatchewan-settlement-plans-funds-requirement"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saskatchewan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their settlement funds. Then when you get a nomination, you need to match the IRCC settlement fund. Find the application fees for different provinces in the table below.Â </span></p>

<h3>Express Entry</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Created by Immigration, Refugee, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry.html">Express Entry</a> is designed for skilled workers and their family members. Presently, if you&#8217;re without a spouse or children, you need to have â¦3,917,581.7962. That amount is the minimum you can have in your savings. If you&#8217;re a couple, you must have a combined sum of â¦4,877,328.8797. That&#8217;s an additional â¦1,055,570.6506. Add that same amount to the initial â¦4,877,328.8797 to make it â¦5,932,899.5303 if you have an additional family member. The calculation goes on in that vein. However, note that this is subject to change every year. Whether your spouse or children are relocating with you to Canada or not, your savings must reflect their own share.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Processing Express Entry profile does not require a fee. But you&#8217;ll have to pay a â¦249,383.1005 visa processing fee after receiving an ITA and submitting a complete application. Then for each child going with you to Canada, you&#8217;ll have to pay an additional â¦68,013.5729.Â </span><b></b></p>

<h3>Cost of Temporary Visa and Immigration Documents</h3>

If you find that the country suits you, you can prepare your immigration application. For this application, you&#8217;ll need documents of your medical examination and language proficiency test results. Find the cost of each visa type in the table below.Â </span></p>

<p><a href="https://lifestyle9.org/worlds-best-country-to-live-in-2013/2/">Canada is ranked as the second-best country</a>&nbsp;in the world behind Germany, from a field of 60 countries for overall sustainability, cultural influence, entrepreneurship, economic influence and most importantly, quality of life.&nbsp; We placed ahead of the U.K., the U.S., and Sweden (if youâre keeping score).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If youâre part of the booming Boomer generation, youâll be happy to know Canada is the 5th best country to grow old in, with our unique old age pension programs and health care system</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>And if thatâs not enough:</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Our economy is the 14th largest, making us one of the wealthiest nations with a<br>consistently high standard of living.</li>
<li>Our unemployment rates are lower than other countries.</li>
<li>Weâre major contributors to quantum computing, medical discoveries, space science and<br>technology.</li>
<li>Weâre one of the most peaceful countries in the world.</li>
<li>While other nations continue to debate the issue, weâve been&nbsp;<a href="https://lifestyle9.org/worlds-best-country-to-live-in-2013/2/">celebrating inclusivity and same-sex marriages for years</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>âAnd weâre polite. In fact, our politeness is one of the reasons we play well with other nations and why our general satisfaction levels consistently rate high.â Thatâs according to the results of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/us-news-unveils-best-countries-rankingsnations">2016 Best Countries survey conducted by U.S. News &amp; World Report</a>, in collaboration with BAV Consulting and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, which surveyed more than 16,000 people in four global regions. Participants were asked to rank 60 countries, covering a wide range of topics that include: adventure, citizenship, entrepreneurship, heritage, influence, movers, open for business, power and quality of life.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In Januaryâs&nbsp;<a href="http://globalnews.ca/news/2465526/canada-named-2nd-best-country-in-the-world-report/">World Economic Forum</a>&nbsp;in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland, Prime Minister Trudeau<br>called Canada a âgreat place to investâ because of our public health care, education, safety and economic stability. That business decision-makers eye Canada as the place theyâd like to locate or relocate their businesses and/or head offices speaks volumes about our quality of life and the opportunities<br>Canada offers.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Our tax structures arenât the highest among nations but they arenât the lowest either. That makes the Canadian workplace, benefits and lifestyle a selling point to organizations seeking to attract and retain a workforce.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/best-start-a-business">Canadaâs also a great place to start a business</a>. Interestingly, in a field where Asian countries typically reign, Canada, at 4th place, was the only non-Asian country to rank in the top five.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>According to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/99-reasons-why-its-better-to-be-canadian/">Macleanâs Magazineâs Canada Day survey</a>:</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>We have greater economic freedom because of our sound, reliable and transparent<br>public finances.</li>
<li>Our banks and banking systems are better and stronger (4 of the top 10 banks in the<br>world were Canadian)</li>
<li>We have a relatively lower unemployment rate than the U.S., particularly among<br>young workers.</li>
<li>We have better health care, benefits, paid holidays and paid leaves, including<br>maternity and paternal leave.</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Our workplaces are mandated by law to be inclusive and welcoming, with opportunities open to all.&nbsp;<a href="http://newsroom.bmo.com/press-releases/bmo-harris-private-banking-changing-face-of-wealth-tsx-bmo-201306130880233001">According to a BMO study</a>, âin Canada, nearly half of millionaires are immigrants or second-generation residents, compared to just one-third in America.â</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There is no shortage of reasons why Canada is not just a great place but the place to live and work. Most of us wouldnât dream of leaving, especially with the looming U.S. presidential election. Weâre smart, kind, funny, musical, technologically advanced, creative, aware, alert and deeply caring. With all this in mind, on July 1st, light candles, watch fireworks, eat birthday cake, join hands and sing âHappy Birthdayâ as loud as you can.</p>
