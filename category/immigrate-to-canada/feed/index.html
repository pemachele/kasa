<p>Did you know that the Canadian passport is one of the most powerful passports in the world? Some passports are deemed more powerful than others. However, the strongest passports are the ones that offer the most outstanding travel freedom to travellers. In this article, you will understand the benefits of a Canadian passport.</p>



<p>While choosing travel destinations, travellers mostly consider destinations they can go to, what documents would be required before entry and the cost. Therefore, the world&#8217;s strongest passports are the ones that easily allow travellers into many countries without supplementary entry requirements like the visa.</p>



<h2><strong>Why the Canadian Passport is One of the Most Powerful</strong></h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.henleypassportindex.com/">Henley Passport Index</a>, a passport is ranked highly if it allows the holders entry into many countries with either of:</p>



<ul><li>Passport</li><li>Visa on arrival</li><li>Electronic travel authorization (eTA)/ online visa waiver.</li></ul>



<p>Using this criterion, Canadian passports are ranked in the 5th group of countries along with the United States, the United Kingdom, Malta, Greece, France, Hungary, Czech Republic, and Poland.</p>



<p>The Canadian passport is ranked 9th place in the most powerful passports in the world according to the <a href="https://www.passportindex.org/">Guide Passport Ranking Index</a>. This means that Canadian passport holders can travel to many world countries visa-free. Out of the existing 195 countries in the world, this <a href="https://visaindex.com/country/canada-passport-ranking/">report</a> shows that a Canadian passport holder can travel to 188 of them without a visa through passport only, a visa on arrival, or via an eTA.</p>



<p>In addition to providing free access to over 180 countries in the world, the Canadian passport is one of the most desirable passports in the world. The holders have free visa access and visa on arrival into countries such as:</p>



<ul><li>The United Kingdom</li><li>The United States</li><li>United Arab Emirates</li><li>Japan</li><li>European Union (the entire EU), etc.</li></ul>



<h2>It allows for instant worldwide travel opportunities for its holders.&nbsp;</h2>



<p>When entering Canada, holders of visa-free passports are required to obtain beforehand, an Electronic Travel Authorization. It costs $7CAD and it can be obtained online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, when flying into a country without visa restrictions, Canadian passport holders will likely be required to show their passports and some other documents such as:</p>



<ul><li>International travel insurance</li><li>Proof of accommodation</li><li>Proof of sufficient financial means</li><li>Countries such as Australia and New Zealand will require holders to submit their Electronic Travel Authorization.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Out of the 188 countries, Canadian passport holders can gain entry without visas, 45 of them will require that you apply for a visa on arrival. The documents that will be required includes:</p>



<ul><li>Passport (with at least, 6 months validity and at least, one blank visa page)</li><li>A proof showing your willingness to leave the country after your visa expires(a return travel ticket)</li><li>Proof of accommodation in your new visiting country (this could be a letter of invitation from a host or a hotel reservation).</li><li>You must demonstrate financial capability enough to cover your stay (<a href="https://mapleeducation.ca/nigeria-student-express-canada/">bank statements</a>)</li></ul>



<p>However, you won&#8217;t necessarily have to show these documents always. The demand for these <a href="https://mapleeducation.ca/canada-student-visa-application/">requirements </a>vary by country and for some, your passport and flight ticket is enough.Â </p>



<h2>Can I get into any country with a Canadian Passport?</h2>



<p>Canadian passport holders are required to obtain visas before they can get into about 41 destinations in the world. Some countries where visas are required for Canadian passport holders include:</p>



<ul><li>India</li><li>Turkey</li><li>China</li><li>Russia, etc.</li></ul>



<p>This <a href="https://visaindex.com/country/canada-passport-ranking/">report</a> shows that there are a total of 138 countries Canadians can visit without a visa, 45 Canada visas on arrival countries, and 5 eTA destinations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) is an immigration program that allows applicants to live in a specific province, contribute to the province&#8217;s economy and gain permanent residence. It is an alternative to the <a href="https://mapleeducation.ca/federal-skilled-worker-program/">Canadian Federal Skilled Worker</a> visa.</p>



<p>It allows provinces and territories to meet the immigration needs of applicants. They do this by helping them fill in-demand jobs and meet labour shortages in the province.</p>



<h2>How Does the Provincial Nominee Program in Canada Work?</h2>



<p>Applicants with eligible Provincial Nomination will have the chance of getting an Invitation to Apply (ITA).</p>



<p>The Provincial Nominee Program in Canada offers these applicants who desire to reside in a specific Canadian province an immigration pathway permanently.</p>



<p>However, these provinces and territories have unique economic and demographic requirements applicants will need to meet. Also, each province or territory has its own streams and requirements to target specific groups of immigrants. The groups may be any of:</p>



<ul><li>Business people</li><li>Skilled workers</li><li>Semi-skilled workers</li><li>Students</li></ul>



<p>Meanwhile, most PNPs will require that applicants already have some connection in the province. The connection involves having previously studied or worked in the province. If not, they must have a job offer from an employer in the province for a job visa.</p>



<p>However, some PNPs do not require any previous connections. You have to apply directly and meet all requirements to gain enough CRS scores. The CRS score qualifies you to receive the Invitation to Apply (ITA). Once your application reaches the Express Entry pool, you will gain an additional CRS score when applying for a PR visa. The minimum CRS score for Express Entry is 692.</p>



<p>Ideally, the program is specifically designed for candidates who cannot meet the minimum criteria to qualify for the PR visa of Canada. Also, candidates who cannot score enough CRS to receive an Invitation to Apply to the Express Entry pool.</p>



<h2><strong>How Can I Get PNP in Canada?</strong></h2>



<p>To get the PNP in Canada, you must meet the set requirements for applicants. Although the documents required for the PNP depends on the specific qualifying standards, there are some essential documents required:</p>



<ul><li>Valid passport</li><li>Recent color photographs</li><li>Identity proof</li><li>General application form of the principal applicant</li><li>Attested documents by the spouse and other dependents</li><li>Documents supporting the spouse and other dependents</li><li>Language skills results</li><li>Educational Credential Assessment (ECA) report</li><li>Police clearance</li><li>Medical certificate</li><li>Proof of fund.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Provincial Nominee Programs Process in Canada</strong></h2>



<p>There are two ways you can apply for the PNP in Canada:</p>



<ul><li>Express Entry System</li><li>Non-Express Entry System</li></ul>



<h3><strong>The Express Entry System can be Processed in Two Ways</strong>:</h3>



<p>The applicants create an Express Entry Profile and reach the Express Entry pool after submitting the necessary documents. The different provinces and territories then pick their suitable applicants, and they are sent the Notification of Interest (NOI). Applicants who receive the NOI can send their Expression of Interest (EOI) to the Express Entry.</p>



<p>In the second way to the Express Entry System, the applicants will check for suitable PNPs and apply for the nomination. They can create the Express Entry profile when the province or territory they applied to agrees for a nomination. There they can show that they have the provincial nomination.</p>



<h3><strong>Non- Express Entry System</strong>:</h3>



<p>The Non-Express Entry System is a paper-based application. The applicants will have to select a suitable province whose eligibility requirements they best meet. They submit the EOI under the non-Entry Express stream. Their application will be assessed based on the point system of the particular territory or province. The selected applicants will receive a nomination letter. Afterward, they must submit a paper application for Permanent Residency (PR) visa to the Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).</p>



<h2><strong>Which PNP is Best in Canada?</strong></h2>



<p>All PNP in Canada is great and unique. The best and easiest will depend on the applicants and their areas of expertise. However, here are the best three:</p>



<h3><strong>Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP):</strong></h3>



<p>This program offers numerous tech job opportunities. It consists of categories to easily allow skilled workers, graduates, and business owners to migrate to Canada.</p>



<p>To apply to this program, you must have a minimum CRS score of 400 points and higher. Also, the program offers streams for both French-speaking Skilled Workers and Skilled Trades Stream.</p>



<h3><strong>Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program (SINP):</strong></h3>



<p>This PNP program offers a broad range of occupations. Applicants who have had difficulties under the Express Entry system will find this program much more accessible.</p>



<p>To qualify, you have to:</p>



<ul><li>Have at most minor, one-year work experience in any jobs in Saskatchewan&#8217;s in-demand occupations</li><li>Have completed your education up to post-secondary level</li><li>Be proficient in either English or French language</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Nova Scotia Nominee Program (NSNP):</strong></h3>



<p>This program offers various options to entrepreneurs, skilled workers, international graduates, and temporary foreign workers.</p>



<p>To qualify to apply, you must have an active Express Entry profile. Also, you must have a job offer from an employer in the province. There&#8217;s another option for candidates who have experience in any of the in-demand occupations in the province. These options are Categories A and B, respectively.</p>



<h2><strong>How Much Does it Cost for PNP Canada?</strong></h2>



<p>The cost of the PNP depends on your specific program:</p>



<ul><li>Ontario Immigration Nominee Program (OINP) costs CAD 1500</li><li>Saskatchewan Immigration Nominee Program (SINP) costs CAD 350</li><li>Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program (MPNP) costs CAD 500</li><li>British Columbia Provincial Nominee Program (BCPNP) costs CAD 1150</li></ul>



<p>The Quebec Skilled Workers Program (QSWP) costs $812:</p>



<ul><li>It costs CAD 785 for the primary applicant</li><li>CAD 168 for spouse or partner</li><li>CAD 168 for dependent child</li></ul>

<p>The Canadian Experience Class is one of the immigration programs through which an individual can get permanent residence in Canada. The CEC is a part of Canada&#8217;s Express Entry immigration system which is specifically designed for individuals who have worked in Canada for at least, one year.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What is Express Entry?</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Express Entry allows IRCC (Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada) to invite competent candidates to make applications for permanent residency in Canada. These candidates will be required to create an online Express Entry Profile to formally make an &#8216;Expression of Interest&#8217; to settle in Canada. If they are eligible, their profiles are accepted and they are assigned a score and indexed under the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) all depending on the personal information provided by them. The CEC is managed under the Express Entry.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Also read: <a href="https://mapleeducation.ca/express-entry-canada/">A comprehensive guide on Express Entry Canada: Eligibility, Requirement and Cost</a></span></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2><strong>Advantages of Canadian Experience Class</strong></h2>



<ul><li>The <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/apply-permanent-residence.html">CEC </a>is processed quickly. The process is often within three to four months.</li><li>Having had a one-year working experience in Canada gives the applicant access to CRS points for their application. It is because work experience is a highly valued factor under the CRS.</li><li>Applicants are not required to provide proof of settlement funds as FSTC and FSWC candidates are.</li></ul>



<p>However, there&#8217;s one drawback and that is that there&#8217;s no promise of receiving an invitation to apply even if you are qualified to apply for the CEC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, you will learn other top five reasons why CEC applications are refused.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Top 5 Reasons CEC Applications are Refused</strong></h2>



<p>To be eligible for the CEC application, you have to meet the eligibility criteria all classified under admissibility, language ability and some other minimum requirements. If you have once tried or failed or hoping you meet all the requirements, continue reading.</p>



<h3>1. <strong>You did not successfully create your Express Entry Profile</strong></h3>



<p>This is the first step and it&#8217;s crucial to avoid mistakes as even the slightest of them can get your application denied.</p>



<h3>2. <strong>You did not complete the following within the three years before your application</strong></h3>



<ul><li>12 months of full-time work:</li><li>30 hours/week for 12 months = 1 year full-time (1,560 hours)</li></ul>



<p><strong>Or</strong></p>



<p>Equal amount in part-time hours, such as:</p>



<ul><li>15 hours/week for 24 months = 1 year full-time (1,560 hours)</li><li>30 hours/week for 12 months at over 1 job = 1 year full-time (1,560 hours).&nbsp; You can choose to work as many part-time jobs as you need to. Also, your work experience must be earned by being under temporary resident status and with an authorization to work.</li></ul>



<p>This one-year work experience must be for the following:</p>



<ul><li>From jobs defined by the Canadian National Occupational Classification (NOC) as level 0, A or B</li><li>For a full-time position or at the same time in a part-time position</li><li>Legally obtained in Canada</li></ul>



<p>These jobs skills must be either one or more of the following:</p>



<ul><li>Managerial jobs (skill level 0)</li><li>Professional jobs (skill type A)</li><li>Technical jobs and skilled trades (skill type&nbsp;B)</li></ul>



<h3>3. <strong>You do not meet the education requirements</strong></h3>



<p>Although there are no specific education requirements, applications are refused if you do not boost your Express Entry score by the following:</p>



<ul><li>Earning a certificate, diploma or degree from a Canadian secondary or tertiary school</li><li>Obtaining a foreign credential</li><li>Obtaining an Educational Credential Assessment (ECA) that demonstrates prior education that meets Canadian standards.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Also read: <a href="https://mapleeducation.ca/federal-skilled-worker-program/">What Is the Canadian Federal Skilled Worker Program?</a></span></p><cite>tap to read</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h3>4. <strong>You do not meet the language requirements</strong></h3>



<p>You may have not taken the approved language test for reading, listening, writing and speaking or you did but neither did well. Below are the language requirements for the CEC:</p>



<ul><li>Benchmark 7 for NOC 0 or A jobs or Canadian Language Benchmark 5 for NOC B jobs.</li></ul>



<p>If your CEC application is refused, your language test could have been invalid as you could not successfully describe the test result in your Express Entry profile or it was taken more than two years before your application.</p>



<h3>5. <strong>You are not admissible</strong></h3>



<p>You are either not legally allowed to get into Canada or you could be a refugee claimant in the country.</p>



<p>Also, you filled to live in the province of Quebec. One of the application processes requires you to fill in where you would want to live and your application will be definitely refused if you filled in Quebec.</p>



<p>Another reason could be an individual filling outside the province or territory that nominated them especially if they are a provincial nominee.</p>



<p>Having listed the top five reasons why CEC applications are refused, here&#8217;s how to be eligible and successfully apply for CEC.</p>



<h2><strong>How to Apply for CEC</strong></h2>



<h3>1. <strong>Work in Canada for one year</strong></h3>



<p>You must have Canadian work experience for at least one year. It is important to note that your self-employment work experience cannot take the place of the Canadian work experience. You can attain this experience through temporary visas such as the working holiday visa.</p>



<h3>2. <strong>Meet the minimum requirements</strong></h3>



<p>Go through the requirements and ensure you meet them all.&nbsp; Also, ensure you complete the approved language tests such as IELTS and/or TEF for English and French respectively.</p>



<p><strong>Create the Express Entry profile</strong></p>



<p>As mentioned above, the CEC is managed under the Express Entry program, to qualify for the CEC, you must create an online Express Entry profile. This will include information on your work experience, age, education, language ability and some other important factors. Your profile is then ranked against other profiles in the pool by the CRS out of their given 1,200 scores.</p>



<p>As should be, candidates with the highest scores are invited to apply for permanent residence in Canada through IRCC.</p>



<p><strong>Gather your documents</strong></p>



<p>If you have received your Invitation to Apply (ITA) for Permanent Residence (PR), you will be required to gather all your documents most of which includes a criminal record check and a medical certificate. And you must submit your application within the first 60 days of your ITA.</p>



<p><strong>Get Permanent Residence Confirmation</strong></p>



<p>CEC applications are usually processed with four months. Once your application is approved, you will receive a confirmation of the PR document.</p>

<p>Permanently immigrating to Canada as a foreigner through express entry is the dream of most young individuals, especially ones who have lived in Canada and worked in Canada for a stipulated period. But how can you successfully immigrate? What is Canada Express Entry? How does Canada Express Entry work?</p>



<p>This article is a complete guide on Canada Express Entry. It explains how to immigrate through express entry; who is eligible to apply for express entry; how to apply and how long the express entry takes, and finally, how to increase your CRS score.</p>



<h2><strong>What is Express Entry System?</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://mapleeducation.ca/professionals-and-skilled-workers/">Express Entry</a> is a point-based immigration program considered the most prominent and quickest pathway for newcomers and professionals seeking to settle in Canada permanently. It is a point-based program because applicants are awarded points based on their skills, experiences, Canadian employment status, age, and provincial/territorial nomination. Applicants with the highest points receive the Invitation to Apply (ITA) for Permanent Residency (PR).</p>



<h2><strong>How Does the Express Entry Work?</strong></h2>



<p>The Express Entry program has three different immigration programs through which applicants can apply:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://mapleeducation.ca/federal-skilled-worker-program/">Federal Skilled Worker</a> (FSW) Program</li><li>Federal Skilled Traders (FST) Program</li><li>Canadian Experience Class Immigration Program</li></ul>



<p>Applicants will be required to submit an Expression of Interest and apply under any type of job as mentioned in skill types 0, A and B. Their applications are assessed solely on points and will be set in the Express Entry application pool.</p>



<p>Afterwards, Canadian provinces and territories will evaluate the application pool and select applicants with the talents that meet their needs. Applicants with the highest scores will be sent the ITA for permanent residence.</p>



<h2><strong>Who is Eligible for Canada Express Entry?</strong></h2>



<p>Typically, there&#8217;s no specific eligibility profile created for every individual applying to meet. However, there are requirements to meet which determines your points.</p>



<p>Because there&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all eligibility profile, the program is open to candidates with college or university degrees with skilled work experiences and reasonable proficiency in English and/or French. Now, this leads us to the requirements for express entry.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="640" height="423" src="https://mapleeducation.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/canada-express-entry.jpg" alt="canada express entry requirements" class="wp-image-4440" srcset="https://mapleeducation.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/canada-express-entry.jpg 640w, https://mapleeducation.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/canada-express-entry-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption>Image: Pixabay</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>Canada Express Entry <strong>Requirements</strong></h2>



<p>As mentioned earlier, the Canada Express Entry is a point-based immigration program with a points scale of 1200.Â  This means that applicants are evaluated based on their information which are the minimum requirements they are expected to meet to be eligible for the program. The central motive is to recognise individuals who have higher chances of succeeding in Canada after immigration.</p>



<p>The eligibility requirement for the Canadian Express Entry point is 67 out of 100 points under different eligibility criteria. The eligibility calculator assesses and scores applicants based on the following criteria:</p>



<h3><strong>Age</strong>:</h3>



<p>The age requirement to qualify to apply for Express Entry is between 18-35 years. Applicants who are younger or older will earner lesser points.</p>



<h3><strong>Education</strong>:</h3>



<p>It is mandatory that your minimum educational qualification must be equivalent to a higher secondary education level in Canada. Applicants with higher educational qualifications, like at least two bachelor&#8217;s degrees or a master&#8217;s degree, earn more points.</p>



<h3><strong>Work experience:</strong></h3>



<p>You must have gained at least one year of work experience of a continuous paid full-time job in the last ten years. You can have the equivalent in part-time by doing as many part-time jobs as possible to gain the equivalent of one year of work experience. Having more also increases your score points.</p>



<p>Also, note that work experiences from volunteering or unpaid internships will not be accepted or scored. They should also not be mentioned in your application. On the other hand, a formal Canadian job offer for a skilled and full-time position can boost your points by 50-200 points. However, it will require a practical Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) for these points to be awarded.</p>



<h3><strong>Language ability:</strong></h3>



<p>You must have taken language tests within the last two years and must have attained at least 6 bands in your IELTS, which equals CLB 7 in either English or French. Higher scores in your language tests increase your points.</p>



<h3><strong>Adaptability</strong>:</h3>



<p>This is one of the biggest boosts to your score points. If you have family members or close relatives who are already living in Canada and support your immigration, you are sure to earn more points. Also, if you have an accompanying spouse or children, you will earn more points too.</p>



<h3><strong>Arranged Employment:</strong></h3>



<p>You will already have attained 10 points if you have been offered employment as of the time of your application.</p>



<h3><strong>Provincial Nomination</strong></h3>



<p>A nomination from a provincial nominee program can also boost your score points.</p>



<p>In all, you must score at least 67 out of 100 percentage points to get your application in the express entry pool. These points are awarded to applicants based on a Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS), and if you meet the required score point or above, you will receive the ITA for PR.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="640" height="423" src="https://mapleeducation.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-much-does-it-cost-for-express-entry.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4443" srcset="https://mapleeducation.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-much-does-it-cost-for-express-entry.jpg 640w, https://mapleeducation.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-much-does-it-cost-for-express-entry-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption>Image: Pixabay</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2><strong>How Much Does Express Entry Cost?</strong></h2>



<p>Here&#8217;s a breakdown of what it costs to apply for the Express Entry:</p>



<ul><li>Language tests &#8211; average cost of&nbsp;$300</li><li>Educational Credential Assessment (ECA) &#8211; average cost of $200</li><li>Biometrics &#8211; average cost of&nbsp;$85 per person</li><li>Government fees &#8211; average cost of $1,325 for adults and $225 per child</li><li>Medical examination fees &#8211; average cost of&nbsp;$450 per adult and $250 per child</li><li>Police clearance certificates &#8211; average cost of $100/country</li></ul>



<p>No further fees or government fees are required to apply or submit your express entry application. The fees listed above are only required after having qualified and sent the ITA to apply for PR.</p>



<p>Also, it is essential to note that unless you are applying for the Canadian Experience Class program or have a valid job offer from a Canadian employer, you will be required to show that you have adequate funds to cater for your resettlement in Canada.</p>

<h2><strong>How do I apply for Canada Express Entry?</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>Create your Express Entry profile</strong></h3>



<p>This is the first step to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/submit-profile.html">begin your application.</a> It should include basic details about you like age, education, work experience, language skills and a few others. You will be scored some points based on your details. Submit your profile and have it set in the express entry pool.</p>



<h3><strong>Complete your ECA</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/education-assessed.html">Educational Credentials Assessment</a> (ECA) verifies that your educational qualification is equivalent to that of the Canadian educational system. If you had a foreign education, you must get your ECA.</p>



<h3><strong>Complete your language tests</strong></h3>



<p>Complete your language ability tests in Either English (IELTS) or the French language &#8211; Test de evaluation de Francians (TEF). You are sure to have an edge if you know both.</p>



<h3><strong>Calculate your Comprehensive Ranking Score (CRS)</strong></h3>



<p>Once your profile is set in the express entry pool, it is ranked based on the CRS score, which is solely based on your provided details.</p>



<h3><strong>Get your Invitation to Apply (ITA)</strong></h3>



<p>Getting an ITA means your profile ranked as one of the highest, and you have been invited to apply for permanent residence in Canada by the Canadian Government. Now, begin the documentation for your permanent residence visa.</p>



<h2><strong>How Long Does Express </strong><strong>Entry</strong><strong> Take?</strong></h2>



<p>From submitting your express entry profile to the issuance of a permanent resident visa, express entry can take about six months to process. However, some applicants may not receive an Invitation to Apply early. But once you have received an Invitation to Apply, you will have 60 days to prepare and submit all the required documents needed to begin the process for your permanent residence application. Once processed, you will receive your visa for permanence residence in six months or less.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, applicants (who did not receive the ITA)&nbsp; profiles can remain active in the express entry pool for 12 months. Applicants who were not invited to apply for permanent residence can reapply by repeating every step and process as in the first application.</p>



<h2><strong>How Do I Increase my Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS score)?</strong></h2>



<p>You must have realised by now that an applicants chances of success at getting the Invitation to Apply as well as receiving their visa for permanent residence depending on their Comprehensive Ranking System score. It is usually difficult to predict how the CRS calculates scores for the applicants as two or more applicants can get into the express entry draws. These applications will automatically be competitive, and no one can predict how the CRS score will change in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The express entry system is quite a long, complicated process that continuously changes and approval is only at the discretion of the IRCC. This way, no one can guarantee that every applicant who scores up to the required points will receive permanent residence.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is vital to do all you can to increase your Comprehensive Ranking System score.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many options through which CRS scores can be increased.&nbsp; Below, you will find six ways to increase your CRS score:</p>



<h3><strong>Take the IELTS again</strong></h3>



<p>If you improve your IELTS score, you stand a bigger chance of increasing your points as great IELTS results can earn you up ton160 points. Also, a good IELTS and post-secondary educational qualification can earn you more 50 points. If you combine all of these with at least three years of work experience, you are sure to earn an additional 50 points.</p>



<p>The language test requirement is to score at least, Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) 7 to apply. However, if you can score up to CLB 9 in all languages, which includes the least 6.0 for express entry under the Federal Skilled Worker (FSW) program on the four language abilities (writing, reading, speaking, reading), you could earn about 260 points for only your language ability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To ensure you score higher in IELTS, you can take IELTS before applying, or you apply, retake and update your express entry profile with your new result.Â </p>



<h3><strong>Accompanying</strong></h3>



<p>This tip can only apply to accompanying candidates. If you have a spouse and a child/children, or even a common-law partner, these can earn you lots of points. You may have three possibilities here to take advantage of to boost your CRS points:</p>



<ul><li>Your spouse retaking the language test and getting their ECA as in the educational requirement mentioned earlier would earn you additional prompts.</li><li>Your spouse could be the stronger applicant. Calculate how many points over yours your spouse could probably score if they were the primary if or not you accompany them.</li><li>You and your partner could be strong applicants. You two could submit your profiles each and list each other as accompanying.</li></ul>



<p>Either of these three possibilities could earn you more points too.</p>



<h3><strong>Job Offer</strong></h3>



<p>As mentioned earlier, getting a Canadian skilled and paid job offer can increase your points by almost 50-200 additionally points. Before your express entry application, network, connect with employers online (LinkedIn is a good place). You could be earning yourself bigger points without knowing it.</p>



<h3><strong>Provincial Nomination</strong></h3>



<p>A provincial nomination earns you an additional 600 points, although you might have to apply for the nomination program, which is entirely a different process. For a province to nominate you, you must meet their requirements which mostly lies in your work experience.</p>



<h3><strong>Work Experience</strong></h3>



<p>Your work experience is a massive part of your application that increases your points. Unlike the language test, it is not easy to improve your work experience at the time of application, but there&#8217;s a way out. If you find that you are eligible to apply or that you are but with a lower score, you can consider coming to Canada as a student or temporary worker first to gain some work experience.&nbsp; These experiences can qualify you for more Canadian immigration options. Also, while you work, ensure you choose the proper National Occupational Classification (NOC) code as the express entry system uses its matrix to assign points to all occupations.</p>



<p><strong>Study</strong></p>



<p>Enrolling for a short program like a <a href="https://maplecc.ca/ossd-in-nigeria/">one-year post-secondary</a> certificate will get you many points, and it doesn&#8217;t matter if you already obtained one in the past three years. This increases your CRS score because, in the express entry system, Canadian education credentials are highly recognised and valued.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>To understand what the Canadian Federal Skilled Worker program is, one must first understand the Canadian Express Entry. The Canadian Express Entry is an online system through which applications for permanent residence in Canada are made by individuals who are looking to migrate. It consists of three different migrating programs which the Federal Skilled Worker program is one. However, a lot of people consider them both immigration programs, which is wrong, and that is the reason for this article. It explains what a Canadian Federal Skilled Worker program is, how to qualify for it and the differences between the Express Entry and the Federal Skilled Worker (FSW) program.</p>



<h2>What is the Canadian Federal Skilled Worker (FSW) Program?</h2>



<p>Canadian Federal Skilled Worker program is one of the three programs in the Canadian&#8217;s Express Entry system mainly for facilitating continual residency applications. It is specifically designed for workers who have gained foreign work experiences and want to migrate to Canada permanently. The program uses the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/criteria-comprehensive-ranking-system/grid.html">Comprehensive Ranking System </a>(CRS) to rank candidates as it is highly competitive. This is the same for all other programs within Express Entry.</p>



<p>To apply for a federal skilled worker program, you must have had a paid skilled work experience. This can either be in salaries or earned commissions. However, volunteer works or unpaid internship work experiences do not qualify you to apply. If you worked part-time, you must have worked a paid part-time job for up to 15 hours/week. You can do as many part-time jobs enough to help you attain the compulsory number of work hours to qualify.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>How Do I Become a Federal Skilled Worker in Canada?</strong></h2>



<p>To qualify for the FSW program, you are expected to meet specific requirements on your level of education, year&#8217;s of experience, your English or French language proficiency and your age. These requirements, all of which, if you meet, increases your chance to score higher in the FSW point system. That is, there&#8217;s a minimum score you will be required to attain to qualify to apply.</p>



<p><strong>Below are the requirements you must meet to qualify:</strong></p>



<h3><strong>1. Education</strong></h3>



<p>If you studied in Canada, you must have obtained a certificate, a diploma or degree from either or all of the following in Canada:</p>



<ul><li>Secondary institution or high school</li><li>Post-secondary institution</li></ul>



<p>On the other hand, if you had foreign education, you will be required to have the following:</p>



<ul><li>A completed credential</li><li>An Educational Credential Assessment (ECA) mainly for immigration purposes.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>You must have earned a minimum of a Canadian high diploma or equivalent in foreign education. The intent is to show that your educational qualification is equivalent to a certificate, diploma or degree from either a Canadian high school or a post-secondary institution.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>2. <strong>Work Experience</strong></h3>



<p>You must be legally working or have worked for at least 12 months. It must be a continuous, full-time work where you gained skilled word experiences within the last ten years.</p>



<p>Your skilled work experiences will be evaluated under the Canadian National Occupational Classification (NOC) Skill Levels:</p>



<ul><li>Skill level 0 &#8211; managerial job</li><li>Skill level A &#8211; professional job</li><li>Skill level B &#8211; technical jobs and skilled trades.</li></ul>



<p>Your application must show that you performed your duties as is in the NOC lead statement while you worked or are working in your primary occupation.</p>



<p>And you must have worked or be working at least 30 hours per week full-time during the last ten years.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="640" height="393" src="https://mapleeducation.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/federal-skilled-worker-program-requirements.jpg" alt="requirements for the federal skilled worker program Canada " class="wp-image-4304" srcset="https://mapleeducation.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/federal-skilled-worker-program-requirements.jpg 640w, https://mapleeducation.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/federal-skilled-worker-program-requirements-300x184.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></div>



<h3>3. <strong>Language Proficiency</strong></h3>



<p>You must have attained level 7 in a minimum of Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) on a recognised English or French language test in these abilities:</p>



<ul><li>Writing</li><li>Reading</li><li>Listening</li><li>Speaking</li></ul>



<p>Generally, language tests are only valid for two years. Your test must be valid at the time of your application.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<h3>4. <strong>Financial Support</strong></h3>



<p>You must prove that you can cater for yourself as well as your accompanying house or children in the settlement in Canada.</p>



<h3>5. <strong>Residence in Canada</strong></h3>



<p>It would be best if you accepted to live anywhere else outside the Province of Quebec. This is mainly because the province of Quebec chooses their own skilled workers. Failure to adhere to this rule in your application will result in disqualification.</p>



<p>Also, if you are a provincial nominee, you are required to settle in the exact territory or province that nominated you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, you will begin with creating an Express Entry profile. This is where the FSW point system comes in.</p>



<p>This is not the same as the Express Entry points. It is the 100-point grid used to evaluate an applicant&#8217;s eligibility for the FSW program. It refers to the scores you accumulate from meeting all the minimum requirements above. You will be required to score at least a minimum of 67 out of 100 points to be eligible to apply.&nbsp; The next steps to follow will be to get your documents ready and submit your profile.</p>



<p>After you have gotten in the Express Entry pool, your profile will be ranked amongst other appplicants, and the applicants with the highest-ranked profiles are invited to apply for permanent residency.</p>



<h2><strong>What is the Difference Between Express Entry and Federal Skilled Worker?</strong></h2>



<p>One distinct difference between the Canadian Express Entry and the FSW is that the Canadian Express Express is an online system through which individuals who are looking to move to Canada permanently and have met all the necessary requirements apply for permanent residence under one of these three federal programs:</p>



<ul><li>Federal skilled worker (FSW)</li><li>Canadian Experience Class (CEC)&nbsp;</li><li>Federal Skilled Trades (FST)</li></ul>



<p>The Federal skilled worker is only a program for permanent residence, as stated above as one of the immigration programs under the Canadian Express Entry. To qualify for the FSW program, you will need to prove you have the financial capability to settle in Canada.&nbsp; This is not the same for all the other programs.</p>



<p>Also, when applying for the FSW, you must have attained a minimum of 67 out of 100 points in the point system to be eligible. However, Express Entry does not have a minimum point for qualification.</p>

<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://mapleeducation.ca/importance-of-internships/">How Important Are Co-Ops and Internships After Graduation?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://mapleeducation.ca">Maple Education</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Co-op and internship, also known as experiential education, provide short-term workplace practical experience that helps graduates transition into the job market. Without some practical experience, graduates find it challenging to get going. In most workplaces, deliverables are expected within tight deadlines and under supervision. A graduate who has never worked in a professional space will struggle to get up to speed in such an environment. This makes it difficult for them to implement their knowledge. What&#8217;s more, due to poor interpersonal skills, they struggle to interact with colleagues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, most hiring managers don&#8217;t hire graduates without some work experience. Recruiters are well aware of the importance of internships and co-op programs. According to a <a href="https://www.naceweb.org/talent-acquisition/candidate-selection/employers-prefer-candidates-with-work-experience/">NACE survey</a>, nearly 91 per cent of employers prefer that their candidates have work experience. While 65 per cent of the total group indicate that they prefer their candidates to have relevant work experience. Concerning how a graduate gained their experience, more than half of respondents prefer that it comes from an internship or co-op.Â </p>



<div class="wp-container-1 wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>What is the difference between co-op and internship in Canada?</h2>



<p>Now that you&#8217;ve learned about the importance of internships and co-op programs, are you still confused about the difference?</p>



<p>Though co-op and internship are a bit similar, the processes are different.</p>



<p>For graduates, a co-op program is merged into your academic curriculum. In co-op, you combine hands-on practice in your area of study with academic instruction.  This gives the student both practical experience in their field, and funds to continue their education. </p>



<p>The Muse defines an internship as <a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/what-is-an-internship-definition-advice">short-term work experience</a> offered by companies and other organizations for students and recent graduates to get some entry-level exposure to a particular industry or field. An internship can be paid or unpaid but the primary purpose is for you to gain more experience.</p>
</div></div>



<h2><strong>Importance of Interns</strong>hips and Co-o<strong>p After Graduation</strong></h2>



<p>The importance of internships and co-op programs can hardly be overstated. Below are some reasons why they are important.Â </p>



<h3><strong>Gain Valuable Experience</strong></h3>



<p>The first thing any recruiter wants to know is the experience of a potential employee. They want to be sure you have something to bring to the company if they employ you. Having internship experience gives you an edge in a <a href="https://mapleeducation.ca/cost-to-relocate-to-canada-from-nigeria/">job market</a> that&#8217;s very competitive.Â </p>



<h3><strong>Higher Starting Salaries&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>With some internship experience and practical knowledge, employers are more open to paying you more. The NACE survey found that graduates with internships and/or co-op experience received 9-12% higher salary than those without similar experience. Recruiters see your internship experience as valuable and they believe that you&#8217;ll be able to adjust quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Test Drive Career Plan</strong></h3>



<p>Most graduates have a career plan, while some aren&#8217;t always sure of their career path. Whichever category you belong to, an internship gives you the opportunity to test drive. During your internship, you&#8217;d mostly do the things you&#8217;d be doing in your chosen career. You get to know if that&#8217;s something you want to do on a daily basis. If it&#8217;s not, you can intern in a different field to test the waters.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Motivation and Work Habits</strong></h3>



<p>To be productive in a professional setting requires more than just knowing the technical side. Developing work habits and staying motivated helps you to be productive. Without these, you may find yourself failing to meet deadlines. Internship instils workplace characteristics in you. This ensures that you can adapt to any new workplace faster than someone without any internship experience.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Chance to Make Some Money and Grow Your Network&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Not all internships are paid, but those that do pay decent salaries. Consider looking out for internship opportunities that pay if you need the money. But even if you don&#8217;t make money, you still get to expand your network, which will come in handy when you need a letter of recommendation. A professional network is important. You never know when you might need something.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Connect With Employers</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Interning is an excellent opportunity to connect with employers. When you intern with a particular organisation, they are more likely to hire you. They know your ability and you already know the company workflow and culture. Hence, you won&#8217;t need a long adaptation time. According to a <a href="https://career.fsu.edu/sites/g/files/upcbnu746/files/2019-nace-internship-and-co-op-survey-executive-summary.pdf">2019 survey</a>, around 70 % of interns and 50% of co-op participants receive a job offer from their co-op employer. Upon accepting a full-time role, some interns even receive signing bonuses.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Opportunity to Travel</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s always great to get out of your comfort zone and go somewhere else. It&#8217;s an opportunity to see more of the world and mix with people from different places. Those who choose to intern in a different state or country get to enjoy these benefits. Some employers even offer to pay a travel stipend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, everyone&#8217;s circumstances are different, and there will always be obstacles. Unless those obstacles are insurmountable, don&#8217;t let them stop you from doing an internship. It&#8217;s the surest way to get employers to offer you jobs full-time.Â </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you wondering if you can move to Canada without IELTS? The IELTS raises a lot of concerns for international students. While those from English-speaking countries think it&#8217;s unfair. Others think it&#8217;s too expensive.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">English is Canada&#8217;s first official language, with French being the second. This is why the Canadian government places a high value on the IELTS, a way to test your English proficiency of foreign nationals. The government wants to be sure that you&#8217;re equipped with a good command of the English language to enable you to communicate sufficiently with the locals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the absence of English language, the government expects you to know how to speak French at least. But what if you don&#8217;t want to take the English language test or the French language test? Does that mean you have no chance of migrating to Canada?</span></p>
<p>Keep reading to learn what your options are.</p>
<h2>How to Move to Canada Without IELTS</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below are ways to move to Canada without IELTS.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3>Look for Universities that Don&#8217;t Require IELTS</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To study in Canada without taking the IELTS, you have to look for universities that don&#8217;t require it. It&#8217;s the universities that usually require English proficiency tests, not the Canadian embassy. So if you can find a university that doesn&#8217;t require international students to produce the IELTS certificate, you have a chance of studying in Canada. You can conduct a search on Google. Meanwhile, some of the top Canadian universities that don&#8217;t require IELTS include the University of Regina, Carleton University, University of Winnipeg, Cambrian College, University of Saskatchewan, and Seneca College, Toronto.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3>Get the English Proficiency Certificate<span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Universities in Canada now offer international students a different route. Instead of taking the IELTS, you can simply provide an English proficiency certificate. This is easy to obtain. If you studied in a school where you were taught in English, simply request your certificate and use it as proof of English proficiency. With this, you don&#8217;t have to go through the rigors of taking the IELTS.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3>Take an Online English Language Course<span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the main reasons most Nigerians don&#8217;t like taking the IELTS is that it&#8217;s expensive. Not to talk of all the preparation required to take the exams successfully. When one considers that Nigeria is an English-speaking country, the need for IELTS diminishes further. You can take an online English language course online instead of IELTS. It is easier than the IELTS, plus it doesn&#8217;t have a standard required for a pass. All you need is the certificate as proof of English language proficiency. Search online and you&#8217;d find plenty of sites offering </span><a href="https://www.fluentu.com/blog/english/online-english-courses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">English language courses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Apply for Canada Work Permit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not many people know that you can apply for a Canadian Work Permit without IELTS. As previously mentioned, the IELTS is simply a way to test if you know the language enough to communicate with others while you&#8217;re in the country. All you need to travel to Canada for work is your work permit. To get a Canadian Work Permit, you need to secure a job offer from your Canadian employer. This is where things get a little trick, though. If your employer doesn&#8217;t ask for your IELTS score, then you&#8217;re through. Fortunately, many employers don&#8217;t ask for it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, Canada is an attractive destination for many Nigerians. The country offers quality education, affordable healthcare, and a good standard of living. The IELTS gives you options and boosts your chances of immigrating to Canada.&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Immigrating to Canada is not a day&#8217;s job. It requires a lot of preparation and making sure all legally required documents are available and submitted. However, there are factors that can deny you entry into Canada and you need to be aware of them. Being aware of these factors will save you time and money and ensure your move is stress-free.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we share 11 factors that can deny you entry into Canada.</span></p>
<h2>11 factors that can deny you entry into Canada</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two broad categories of inadmissibility in Canada. The first category is known as criminal inadmissibility and the second as medical inadmissibility. Anything that falls outside these two categories is classified under Others. Criminal offencesâminor or major, old or recentâare all classified under criminal inadmissibility. Similarly, all health issues fall under medical inadmissibility. Under the following categories, we discuss factors that can deny you entry into Canada.Â </span></p>
<h2>Medical inadmissibility</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subsection 38(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) makes provision for this. A medical officer will look at your official medical documentation and also assess your health before entry. The following fall under this category.Â </span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3>Potential to require excessive health or social service</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a medical condition that requires a lot of health or social services is grounds for medical inadmissibility. This is because Canada does everything it can not to put too much strain on its healthcare system. So you should probably expect not to be admitted if you have one such condition. Your common-law partner or spouse is exempt from this clause. Even those with such a condition can also find a way around it. This medical inadmissibility can be excused if you apply for Temporary Resident Permit (TRP through your lawyer. You can also apply for </span><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/humanitarian-compassionate-consideration/processing.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">humanitarian and compassionate discretion (H&amp;C).</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This takes public policies into account and offsprings directly affected.Â </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3>Health risk to the public<span style="font-weight: 400;">Â </span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things the medical officer will check is whether you have an infectious condition. Or whether your existing condition has the potential to put the Canadian public in any kind of danger. You may be inadmissible if you have schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. These two conditions can cause irrational behaviour or violent outbursts, which puts the public in danger. Influenza, hepatitis, and measles are all communicable diseases and are grounds for inadmissibility.Â </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Criminal inadmissibility</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Criminal inadmissibility is the most common reason for inadmissibility. Canada takes crime very seriously, past or present, minor or major. Even if the crime happened in a foreign nationalâs home country. Below are some factors that might make you inadmissible under this category.Â </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3>Human rights violations<span style="font-weight: 400;">Â </span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;ve ever been involved in any human rights violation, you may be inadmissible to enter Canada. People frequently found to be guilty of gross human right violations are mostly top government officials. Especially those who served in internationally sanctioned governments.Â </span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3>Organised crime</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Present or past involvement in organised crime is grounds for inadmissibility into Canada. Some examples include being a past or current member of a mafia, terrorist group, gang, or other organised crime groups.Â </span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3>Past criminal conviction</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone convicted of any past criminal offence may be denied entry at the port. To be denied entry under this category, you mustâve been convicted of a crime considered illegal in your home country and Canada. Some examples include manslaughter, reckless driving, assault, theft, and drug possession.Â </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Other kinds of inadmissibility</h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3>Misrepresentation<span style="font-weight: 400;">Â </span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Misrepresentation includes a wide range of things. Withholding or skewing information that prevents or affects the full enforcement of the Canadian immigration laws is considered misrepresentation. Forging a signature is a misrepresentation. So is changing your date of birth or marital status to take advantage of a particular class to migrate. You could go to jail or get a two-year ban from Canada if you&#8217;re found guilty of misrepresentation.Â </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3>Potential to overstay<span style="font-weight: 400;">Â </span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You could be denied entry to Canada on the suspicion that you might overstay. Officials suspect this if there&#8217;s evidence that you overstayed in the country before. Overstaying means being in the country after the expiration of your visa.Â </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3>Travelling with an inadmissible family member<span style="font-weight: 400;">Â </span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travelling with a family member who&#8217;s inadmissible will automatically make you inadmissible too. That family member might be inadmissible for any of the reasons above. A Canadian official will determine this.Â </span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3>Noncompliance with any provisions of the IRA</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Failure to comply with any of IRA&#8217;s provisions makes you inadmissible to enter Canada. Trying to re-enter the country unauthorised after deportation is a noncompliance issue. Likewise, studying in Canada without proper permits or failure to meet residency obligations as a permanent resident. A Removal Order is usually issued for cases of noncompliance.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of solutions, cases of inadmissibility can be reversed. If you&#8217;re issued a Removal Order, you may return to the country by applying for an </span><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/inadmissibility/reasons/authorization-return-canada.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authorization to Return to Canada (ARC)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> document. Note that the ARC will not be issued unless you pay the government back for removal costs. For criminal inadmissibility, you may go for Criminal Rehabilitation. You can only qualify for this five years after committing the offence. Once you complete the rehabilitation, you&#8217;ll be free to enter Canada without having to apply for a Temporary Resident Permit every time.Â </span></p>
