<p>The University of Ottawa has announced millions of scholarships for African students for the 2022/2023 Academic&nbsp; Year. The entrance and excellence scholarship will provide incoming students with a four-year scholarship to cover the partial cost of their university tuition.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Entrance &amp; Excellence Scholarship for African Students Studying in English&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The University of Ottawa is proud of the diversity of its international student body. This renewable scholarship is offered to international students who are citizens of African countries, who are admitted in the Fall 2022 term (September start date)&nbsp; or later with an admission average of 80% or higher, who are studying in English, and who enroll in one of the specified undergraduate programs in the faculties of Engineering, Science, or Social Sciences. This significant financial contribution to their education reduces their tuition fees by $17,500 &#8211; $25,000 for the excellent scholarships and by $12,000 &#8211; $20,000 for the entrance scholarships, depending on the program annually.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>All students who are eligible for this scholarship will automatically receive it upon enrolment. It will be applied directly to their tuition fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Entrance scholarship cannot be combined with the Excellence Scholarship for African Students Studying in English.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our scholarship program is one of the most generous in Canada. It rewards not only your pre-university academic achievements but also your achievements every term of full-time study at University. The new scholarship will give African students studying in English access to numerous pilot programs in three faculties for a significantly reduced cost of tuition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>In a bid to assist students throughout the application process, the University of Ottawa will host a number of virtual sessions to answer questions and guide prospective students on the application process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>All eligible students are considered for this award and will be notified at the time of their admission. Although no application is required for this scholarship, recipients will be asked to submit proof of citizenship of a country of territory in Africa before receiving their first installments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The application deadline for all 2022 nominations is on or before 1st April 2022.&nbsp;To get started fill out our chat widget and a representative would reach out to you.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many students have always had the passion to study Law, right from their days in High school the dream to stand in a law court is one that they have always relished. As fulfilling as Law can be especially in Canada and any other place in the world. It takes great will, hard work and dedication more like any course you want to study &#8211; but there is a slight twist if you want to study law in Canada as a Nigerian student.</p>
<p>Law among other courses like Medicine, Pharmacy, Dentistry cannot be studied by an international student as a first degree but do we have successful lawyers from international waters? Of course, we do. For the record, Maple Education Canada has had students who are currently Lawyers in Canada.</p>
<p>This article is not intended to scare or derail you from that career you have chosen for yourself. However, it prepares you to scale the career hurdles and be the person you want to be. That being said let us discuss how to apply to law school and how law schools in Canada make their decisions and institutions that offer LAW courses.</p>
<h2>IS THERE DEMAND FOR LAWYERS IN CANADA?</h2>
<p>L<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-field-of-law-has-the-highest-demand-for-lawyers-in-Canada">awyers are in demand in Canada today</a>, although the route in becoming one can be extremely challenging. In the last few years, between 5000 and 7000 applicants have competed for approximately 2,350 first-year places in Canada‘s common law school. The admissions committees are faced with denying admission to many well-qualified applicants due to limited space and resources, and no single qualification by itself will guarantee acceptance or rejection. However, in order to be fair, schools rely heavily on selection criteria that include LSAT, and achievements that relate to expected performance in law school.</p>
<h2>
HOW TO APPLY TO LAW SCHOOL</h2>
<h3>
ACQUIRE AN UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE:</h3>
<p>Any university degree is good preparation for law school, e.g. BA, BSc, BBA, BComm, BEng. BMus, BPHE, BKin, etc. There are students who have degrees in Engineering, Biochemistry, English Literature, Political Science, Economics, Music, etc. For your initial undergraduate degree, select the program that you will enjoy studying since no subject is better than another for getting into law school. Undergraduate degrees are typically designed to be completed in four years of full-time studies. Students from higher education institutions across the world are generally eligible for acceptance into law school. In order to qualify, most Canadian law schools require the completion of at least three years of your degree or a completed degree.<br />
Even if the law school you are applying to does not require it, your application will be more competitive if you have completed your undergraduate degree. Most times many law students have completed at least a four-year degree. In recent years, approximately five very exceptional applicants a year have been admitted without completing a four-year undergraduate degree.</p>
<h3>WRITE A LAW SCHOOL ADMISSION TEST (LSAT):</h3>
<p>Nearly all Canadian schools require the standard LSAT, which is held in many countries throughout the world. The test is held up to six times a year (July, September, November, January, March and June) and consists of several sections of questions and problems designed to test reading, comprehension, and your ability to think logically and analytically. It does not test factual information on any subject area, including law, therefore it does not rely on what subject(s) you study in school to do well on the LSAT. Raw scores are converted to an LSAT scale that ranges from 120 to 180, with 120 being the lowest and 180 the highest possible score.</p>
<h2>
HOW DO LAW SCHOOLS MAKE ADMISSION DECISIONS</h2>
<p>Before a law school can make an admission decision, it must receive your</p>
<ul>
<li>Letter of Application</li>
<li>Law school report</li>
<li>Letter of Recommendation</li>
<li>Personal Statement</li>
<li>Application fee</li>
<li>Any additional requirement unique to that particular school</li>
</ul>
<h3>PRO AND CONS OF STUDYING LAW IN CANADA</h3>
<p>It is really easy working your way to the top when you get into law school in Canada but the problem is, there is a very slim chance of getting into law school because there are not enough law schools and available schools have very limited slots. In such slots, only the strongest candidates get selected because admission is based on merit. However, there are benefits of studying law in Canada, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Canada provides an internship program where international law students can intern while studying. A student can decide to intern under his/her professors, including handling pro bono cases or working in the law clinic while studying.</li>
<li>Compared to other countries, studying law in Canada is very affordable and fee friendly</li>
<li>The certificate is highly recognized and it gives you lifelong skills respected by employers across the globe.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are universities in Canada that offer law:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dalhousie University</li>
<li>University of Western Ontario</li>
<li>Lake Head University</li>
<li>Thompson Rivers University</li>
<li>Alberta University</li>
<li>University of Calgary</li>
<li>University of New Brunswick</li>
<li>University of Ottawa</li>
<li>University of Saskatchewan</li>
<li>University of Toronto</li>
<li>University of British Columbia</li>
<li>Universities of Victoria</li>
<li>University of Windsor</li>
<li>University of Moncton</li>
<li>University of Montreal</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada is one of the top destinations to study for international students. According to CIC news, </span><a href="https://www.cicnews.com/2020/02/while-the-us-blocks-immigration-visas-canada-building-strong-nigerian-community-0213706.html#gs.van2sb"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerians were the fourth most represented nationality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> among Canada’s new permanent residents in 2019. This is not surprising because of the benefits available to students who want to study in Canada from Nigeria. In light of this, Canada introduced a new pilot program, the Nigerian Student Express (NSE), for prospective international students from Nigeria seeking to study at the country’s colleges and universities. This initiative is aimed at facilitating the study permit application process at a quicker pace.</span></p>



<h2><b>What is the Nigerian Student Express initiative?</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the Nigerian Student Express, the average processing times for study permit application for Nigerian students was around eight weeks. But with the NSE, Nigerian students can now process their study permit in 20 days or even less. IRCC (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada) said in a</span><a href="https://twitter.com/CitImmCanada/status/1232698222877036546?s=19"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">tweet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “Nigeria Student Express is a pilot initiative at our Visa Office (VO) in Lagos aimed at improving processing times for study permit applicants in Nigeria who are planning to study at the university level in Canada. It was introduced to prospective students and their parents at EduCanada fairs in Abuja and Lagos in January 2020.”</span></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="oceanwp-oembed-wrap clr"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/2 Hi. Nigeria Student Express is a pilot initiative at our visa office (VO) in Lagos aimed at improving processing times for study permit applicants in Nigeria who are planning to study at the university level in Canada.</p>&mdash; IRCC (@CitImmCanada) <a href="https://twitter.com/CitImmCanada/status/1232698222877036546?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 26, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
</div></figure>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NSE differs from Student Direct Stream (SDS). Though they are both designed to expedite the study permit process for students, SDS is only open to students from China, India, Morocco, Pakistan, the Philippines, Senegal, and Vietnam. However, the NSE is only for students from Nigeria who have received admission letters for degree studies. The NSE also uses a different financial verification within known as MyBankStatement.</span></p>



<h2><b>What are the Nigerian Student Express Requirements?</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like most study permit processes, there are rules that make you eligible for the program. The following are the eligibility requirements for NSE.</span></p>



<ul><li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You must be living outside of Canada when you apply.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You must score a minimum of 6 on the Canadian Language Benchmark test.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You need to be a Nigerian citizen or legal resident of Nigeria.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You must have an offer of admission from a Canadian post-secondary institute for a Bachelors, Masters, PhD or post-graduate diploma.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You must have the equivalent of 30,000 Canadian dollars in your bank account for at least 6 months.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You must attach your ticket number from MyBankStatement (A special type of bank statement).</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You must undergo a medical exam.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You must get a police clearance letter.&nbsp;</span></li></ul>

<h2><b>Frequently Asked Questions About the Nigerian Student Express Canada.</b></h2>

<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stanbic Bank</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access Bank</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zenith Bank</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polaris Bank</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guaranty Trust Bank</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First City Monument Bank</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heritage Banking Company</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecobank</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">United Bank for Africa</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sterling Bank</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fidelity Bank</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Union Bank</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wema Bank.</span></li><li>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Do I have to submit a MyBankStatement for NES?</strong></span></h3>
</li></ul>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. You may do so for Canadian Visa Application either by printing it for submission along with your paper visa application or upload the soft copy as part of your online visa application.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the information on Nigeria Student Express is not yet on the Government of Canada website. However, we think that this is due to the program being a pilot initiative.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No other country on the African continent sends more students abroad than Nigeria. <a href="https://wenr.wes.org/2017/03/african-student-mobility-insights-and-recommendation-for-u-s-heis">Data from the UNESCO Institute of Statistics</a> reports that the number of Nigerian students abroad shot up by 164 per cent in the ten years between 2005 and 2015 alone. It went from 26,997 to a whopping 71,351 students to be precise. With this huge number of students going outside the shores of Nigeria to study, there&#8217;s a steady demand for admission agents in the country. Aware of this huge demand, some opportunistic characters pose as admission agents to cheat unsuspecting students out of their hard-earned money. This article will point out some steps to take before hiring study abroad agents in Nigeria. </span></p>
<h2><b>What you should know before hiring study abroad agents in Nigeria</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following are things to verify before you begin working with study abroad agents in Nigeria. </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><b> Ask if they are registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registering with the Corporate Affairs Commission and other authorities legitimizes their existence to some extent. So before you hire an agent, find out if they are accredited agents. Ask if they are registered with the  Corporate Affairs Commission and other bodies like International Consultants for Education and Fairs, Association of Agents for Overseas Studies Recruitment of Nigeria, British Council, and The Quality International Study Abroad Network. </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><b>Check for identifiers and operating office</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check to be sure that the agency you&#8217;re hiring has an operating office and official email identifiers. Don&#8217;t settle for an agency that operates with emails that bear personal names and have no known operating offices. For instance, Maple Education has offices in Lagos, Ikeja, Abuja, and Port-Harcourt. You can reach each of these offices through a different official email that carries the name of the organisation and the location of that particular office. The Lagos office can be contacted through mapleclientconcerns@mapleeducation.ca, while the Ikeja office can be reached through infoikj@mapleeducation.ca. The offices in Abuja and Port-Harcourt can be contacted through infoabj@mapleeducation.ca and infoph@mapleeducation.ca respectively. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Check their testimonials</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no better way to know how an agent goes about the services they offer than checking to see what others who have used their services are saying about them. Go to their website and dig out their testimonial page. You may need to be careful if they don&#8217;t have any testimonials on their website. Or if they don’t even have a website at all. </span></p>
<h2><b>How to identify fake study abroad agents</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When choosing an admission agent, below are ways to spot untrustworthy agents. </span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>They promise you a visa</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No agent or agency has the power to guarantee you any visa. Only the embassy in Nigeria has the authority to issue a visa to you. Don&#8217;t readily believe any agent who tells you that they have contacts at the embassy who can guarantee your visa. Can agents assist you with your visa application? Of course, they can. But that&#8217;s as far as they go. At Maple Education, we can guide you on which of the immigration pathways to Canada you are eligible for. We also help you to track if you have the necessary documents to gain admission and scholarships to Universities in Canada.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>They want to help you send fake documents to the embassy</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your agent or agency encourages you to send fake documents to the embassy, whether tacitly or directly, that immediately calls their legitimacy into question. A trustworthy agent would do their best to assist you without advising you to do something fraudulent. This is because they know that this can get you blacklisted. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3><b>They assure you of admission</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only institution capable of giving you admission is the university or college you are applying to. The agent has no hand whatsoever in offering you admission into the school of your choice. If an admission agent has affiliate schools, they can fasten the admission process which is a legal perk but not offer admission if you don&#8217;t meet requirements. An agent might assure you of admission as a way to wring more money out of you. Most university websites let you check the status of your admission. </span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>They inflate the fees</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t just hang on to every word an agent tells you. Some agents inflate the tuition or accommodation fees in an attempt to get a cut from it. Also, make sure you go to the university website to verify the information before going ahead with paying. Anything you don&#8217;t understand on the site, there are usually email addresses to contact on the site and ask questions. </span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>They may send you to an unaccredited university </b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whichever university you&#8217;re applying to, make sure they are recognised by both the Nigerian authorities and the authorities in that country as well. An agent can send you to an unknown, unaccredited university. Stay on top of the situation by verifying information about your school of choice.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you wondering why more people want to move</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to Canada from Nigeria? Based on Google trend reports, there has been a continuous rising spike in the number of Nigerians searching for how to study in Canada and how to migrate to Canada.</span></p>

<h2><b>Why study in Canada as a Nigerian student</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The education we receive plays an integral role in who we become as individuals and the contributions we’ll be prepared to offer to society. Here are 6 benefits of studying in Canada:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3><strong>You will have access to easy and friendly immigration pathways</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The immigration process to Canada is not tedious as long as you have all the necessary requirements. For Nigerians, Canada introduced</span><a href="https://www.cicnews.com/2020/03/canada-introduces-program-to-fast-track-study-permit-processing-from-nigeria-0313846.html#gs.us93lv"><span style="font-weight: 400;">  The Nigeria Student Express (NSE),</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a pilot initiative for Nigerians who have been accepted to a Canadian post-secondary institution. The NSE effectively shortens the time frame of getting a study permit from an average of eight weeks to 20 days.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3><strong>You will get to experience a high quality of education</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studying in Canada gives you the chance to experience one of the highest quality of education in the world. The education standards they adhere to is why it’s a choice country of study for most international students. You can rest assured that you will be armed with a globally recognised certificate and will be qualified for jobs anywhere in the world.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3><strong>Canada is well known for its affordable tuition costs</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many international students, the highlight of studying in Canada is the low tuition cost. For the same quality of education in the US and UK, you will be spending a lower amount. When you also consider the lower cost of accommodation and living expenses, you will be getting a better deal. As an international student, you are also eligible for a number of </span><a href="https://www.educanada.ca/scholarships-bourses/non_can/index.aspx?lang=eng"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scholarships opportunities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to support you through your education.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3>You will experience a diverse culture</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada is home to people from different nationalities and religions. It is culturally diverse and has English and French as their official languages. Though language barriers are often a concern when moving to a foreign country, that will not be a problem for Nigerians. When it comes to safety, Canada is one of the safest countries in the world with a safety index of 58.12.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>You will have access to work opportunities</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike most countries where there are severe restrictions on being a student and also having a job, it&#8217;s easier to work and study in Canada. There is a high availability of job opportunities both for those who are still in school and for those who want to move there to work and live.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>You&#8217;ll have the opportunity to stay in Canada after graduation</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You also have the opportunity of becoming a permanent resident after your studies in Canada. Also, there&#8217;s room and encouragement for you to stay back and build a life in the country. </span></p>
<h2><b>Entry requirements for Canadian universities for Nigerians</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are varying entry requirements to Canadian universities depending on your stage of education and the school you’ve chosen. If you decide to study in Canada from Nigeria, here is the standard process of making your dream come true: </span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3>Select a school</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step is to choose a course/program of study. Then you’ll need to find a university or college that offers your program. You can check out our list of </span><a href="https://mapleeducation.ca/affiliated-institutions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">affiliated schools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Canada offers a variety of degrees and courses, so you will most likely find one that suits your needs.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3>Get the necessary documents ready</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most schools have their own specific documents that will be requested when you apply so ensure you find that out. Check out this </span><a href="https://mapleeducation.ca/study-in-canada/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">comprehensive checklist of documents that will be requested to study in Canada</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for undergraduates and those going for postgraduate programmes.  </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3><strong>Apply to your school of choice</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next step is to send in your application to your school of choice and wait for an offer letter. Once you get this, you can then move to the next step!</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3><strong>Apply for your visa</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, apply for your visa and study permit. It&#8217;s essential that you start this application as soon as you receive your offer letter because international students cannot stay in Canada without the required visa.</span></p>
<h2><b>How you can get a speedy admission to a prestigious school in Canada</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We encourage applicants to begin the process at least one year or more ahead. This is to provide you with ample opportunity to prepare and move from one phase to the next. You could choose to do the research yourself and spend your time with it. Maple Education Canada has built a relationship with their affiliate schools over a decade of helping students get into their school of choice. It makes it possible to offer prospective students a speedy application process. We are also able to ensure quality documentation through certified Canadian Immigration Consultants that are always up-to-date on current immigration processes and information. Contact us to assist with your study permit application and if you have an admission offer, please send an email with your offer letter to admissions@mapleeducation.ca to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">begin your visa processing</span></p>
