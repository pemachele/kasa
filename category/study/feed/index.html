<p>The University of Ottawa has announced millions of scholarships for African students for the 2022/2023 Academic&nbsp; Year. The entrance and excellence scholarship will provide incoming students with a four-year scholarship to cover the partial cost of their university tuition.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Entrance &amp; Excellence Scholarship for African Students Studying in English&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The University of Ottawa is proud of the diversity of its international student body. This renewable scholarship is offered to international students who are citizens of African countries, who are admitted in the Fall 2022 term (September start date)&nbsp; or later with an admission average of 80% or higher, who are studying in English, and who enroll in one of the specified undergraduate programs in the faculties of Engineering, Science, or Social Sciences. This significant financial contribution to their education reduces their tuition fees by $17,500 &#8211; $25,000 for the excellent scholarships and by $12,000 &#8211; $20,000 for the entrance scholarships, depending on the program annually.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>All students who are eligible for this scholarship will automatically receive it upon enrolment. It will be applied directly to their tuition fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Entrance scholarship cannot be combined with the Excellence Scholarship for African Students Studying in English.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our scholarship program is one of the most generous in Canada. It rewards not only your pre-university academic achievements but also your achievements every term of full-time study at University. The new scholarship will give African students studying in English access to numerous pilot programs in three faculties for a significantly reduced cost of tuition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>In a bid to assist students throughout the application process, the University of Ottawa will host a number of virtual sessions to answer questions and guide prospective students on the application process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>All eligible students are considered for this award and will be notified at the time of their admission. Although no application is required for this scholarship, recipients will be asked to submit proof of citizenship of a country of territory in Africa before receiving their first installments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The application deadline for all 2022 nominations is on or before 1st April 2022.&nbsp;To get started fill out our chat widget and a representative would reach out to you.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Sometime in the past decade, Canada became a highly sought after destination for both prospective immigrants and students. Their popularity skyrocketed due to the good quality of education,&nbsp; their vibrant culture and the government’s welcoming policies geared towards students. The universities’ prioritization of research, international collaborations and scientific publications also keep them in demand. Every year,&nbsp; Canadian universities accept over 130,000 international students into their schools. So how do you make sure you get a student visa also known as a study permit for Canada? Let’s find out.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>How To Apply For A Canada Student Visa </h2>



<h3>MAKE SURE YOU FULFILL THE LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS FOR CANADA&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Before you apply to a Canadian university, you must make sure that you meet the language requirement. Unless you come from an English-speaking country, Canadian universities will require proof of your proficiency in the English language. Acceptable tests include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://mapleeducation.ca/ielts-training/" data-type="page" data-id="2317">IELTS Academic</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/exams-and-tests/advanced/">C1 Advanced</a></li><li><a href="https://pearsonpte.com/">PTE Academic</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ets.org/toefl">TOEFL iBT</a></li></ul>



<h3>APPLY TO A CANADIAN UNIVERSITY&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Before you begin your visa application journey, you have to first apply and secure a spot at any Canadian university of choice. This choice is of course dependent on your needs and grades. For science courses, you can apply to the University of Toronto, for business school you can check any in our <a href="https://mapleeducation.ca/top-business-schools-in-canada/">list</a> and so on. Once you have produced the necessary information and satisfied their grade requirements, you will most likely be sent an acceptance letter. This will help in your next stage. </p>

<h3>ASSEMBLE THE REQUIRED DOCUMENTS&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Before applying for the student permit, collate all the documents needed for the application. You will need&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Your filled-in student application form.&nbsp;</li><li>The original copy of the acceptance letter.&nbsp;</li><li>A valid passport or travel document.&nbsp;</li><li>Two recent passport size photographs with your name and date of birth on the back.&nbsp;</li><li>Proof of financial support for the selected programme. This is between 10,000-11000 CAD per year.&nbsp;</li><li>A letter of intent.&nbsp;</li><li>Proof of payment for the study visa application. (150 CAD)</li><li>If your school is in Québec, you will need a Certificat d’acceptation du Québec, English and French translations of your documents, statement from a translator and a certified copy of the original documents.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3>APPLY FOR A CANADA STUDENT VISA </h3>



<p>After your acceptance letter from your university of choice has arrived, apply for a Canadian Student Visa online via the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship.html">Citizenship and Immigration Canada </a>(CIC) website. You can either submit the required documents by post or online. You will be asked for the acceptance letter, show that you can afford your studies, present proof of no criminal record and a good bill of health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have a family member living or working in Canada, this permit will be processed in about two weeks. It will last for the duration of your studies and expire 90 days after. You can renew if your programmer is extended, you wish to continue your studies or you switch universities. If your study programme is less than six months you will not need a student visa. Instead, you will only need a regular visa. You can use the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/study-permit-tool.html">Canadian study permit tool</a> to be certain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>SCHEDULE A BIOMETRICS APPOINTMENT&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Depending on your country, you might be asked to show up at a visa application centre in your country to have your biometrics taken. The fee for this is 85 CAD and is exempt from the initial visa application fee which is 150 CAD. You may also be asked to an interview in your county’s Canadian embassy or application centre. They may charge a small fee.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>WAIT FOR YOUR PERMIT</h3>



<p>After fulfilling all the requirements, you wait for the permit to be processed. This takes about 90 days but usually faster depending on your country. This is also faster if you have family in Canada.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you do not have family there and wish to get your visa faster, use the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/student-direct-stream.html">student direct stream</a>. Fees start at 150 CAD and it takes about 20 days to process. However, this is only available to students in China, Morocco, India, Pakistan, The Philippines, Vietnam and Senegal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a simple step by step process on how to get your Canadian student visa. Please note that this does not act as a regular visa. You will still need a travel visa or an <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/eta.html">Electronic Travel Authorization</a>. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Corona-virus pandemic plaguing the world is not a pleasant tale and is currently leaving behind a lot of chaos. According to W.H.O, there are more than 132,000 cases of Corona-virus with the death toll reaching up to 5000 persons. W.H.O declared the outbreak of the disease a pandemic. This resulted in Italy tightened its strict quarantine rules and the USA imposing a ban on flights from Europe, with an exception of England and Ireland. So how does the coronavirus impact Canada and student admissions?</p>
<p>There are over 63 Countries affected by the pandemic virus, and Canada has been recorded as one of the infected countries. According to WHO, The Great White North has recorded 690 confirmed cases with Nine people dead from the virus. Since the outbreak, the Canadian Authorities: The Public Health Agency of Canada &#8211; along with public health authorities at all levels of government across the country – have been working tirelessly to ensure the pandemic is curtailed in the country.</p>
<p><b>CORONAVIRUS: NIGERIA TO CANADA.</b></p>
<p>After, several speculations, invocations and finally convictions, the life-threatening disease has finally found its way through to Africa, crossing different borders to Nigeria. The populace has become disturbed and bewildered over the past few days and rightly so with the devastating rate at which the virus is wiping out humanity.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ncdc.gov.ng/news/227/first-case-of-corona-virus-disease-confirmed-in-nigeria">first case of the pandemic</a> was recorded on the 24th of February when an Italian citizen who entered our beloved country on a Turkish Airline from Milan via Istanbul. According to the Lagos Commissioner for Health, Professor Akin Abayomi, there are new cases of the Pandemic COVID-19 in Lagos. It is traumatizing to know that COVID-19 is here in Nigeria, one cannot even begin to imagine what havoc the deadly virus is wreaking. To further confirm our greatest fear, there have been 12 recorded cases with one person dying from the virus. Although, the Nigerian government has started taking an expeditious move to arrest the spread of the disease which has become a global threat.</p>
<p>In view of this, restriction to the country has been placed by the Federal government to the travellers from 13 countries who have reported 1,000 cases of the pandemic including the United Kingdom and the USA leaving Canada out of the blacklisted countries.</p>
<p>As a part of the preventive measures against the spread of the virus, the federal has announced the closing of all public and private secondary schools and varsities in Nigeria from Monday, March 23, 2020. The move is to prevent both teacher and school from being vulnerable to the life-threatening disease and to practice social distancing. Consequently, an agreement was made with religious leaders to ban religious gathering more than 50 worshipers to curtail the spread of this deadly virus.</p>
<p>Regardless of the mitigation strategy to limit the spread of COVID -19, The Nigerian High Commission Canada will proceed with issuing Emergency Travel Certificate (ETC) and visas to those who need to travel urgently.</p>
<p><b>CAN CORONAVIRUS AFFECT MY ADMISSION AND VISA PROCESSING? </b></p>
<p>With the new travel restriction imposed by the Canadian government, there have been huge concerns whether admissions and visa processing to Canadian institutions are still ongoing for both summer and fall intake. As a reputable Canadian Immigration Consulting firm, we will be shedding more light on information reaching us from Canada and our affiliate institutions concerning the COVID-19 and your entry to Canada in general.</p>
<p>According to the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, all international visitors to Canada who are non-Canadian citizens or permanent residents will be turned around at the airport except for Americans, Diplomats and flight crew. This is a conscious effort by the government to curb contact between people, and hopefully stem community transmission of the virus. Regardless of how long Coronavirus is willing to stay, admission and visa processing are still ongoing for September intake. <b>The million-dollar question at this point is, how is this possible? </b></p>
<p>Students may be able to take classes online if the travel ban continues until May. If you have a valid study permit for a May start date, you might have to defer admission to a later date or seek advice from your institution immediately. However, there is a need to confirm that your institution adapts to the changes. In spite of the global uncertainty surrounding education, you will have access to course notes from your intended program of study as well as any support you require.</p>
<p><b>HOW CAN I APPLY FOR MY ADMISSION DURING THIS TIME? </b></p>
<p>If you have started your <a href="https://mapleeducation.ca/study-in-canada-from-nigeria/">admission processing</a> or on the verge of kicking off this process, there is nothing to worry about. We understand the importance of social distancing and the need to stay safe during this period. Consequently, we have shifted all physical presence online for us to attend to your needs, and also to ensure your safety. You can always send a mail of inquiry to our admission team concerning your application to your preferred institution. Preferably, see contact details if you would like to speak to any member of our team for assistance. At Maple Education Canada, your safety is paramount to us, therefore, we advise that you stay safe this period.</p>
