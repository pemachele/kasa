<p>Canada has released the <a href="https://www.cicnews.com/2021/07/how-to-apply-for-canadas-new-tr-to-pr-open-work-permit-0718719.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter-20210728#gs.9rhpaj">guide for applying for the new open work permit</a> to enable the essential workers and international students who applied for the TR to PR pathways to extend their stay in Canada.</p>



<p>The TR to PR programs were launched in May to offer immigration pathways to essential workers, international students, and French speakers who already had temporary residence documents in Canada.</p>



<p>The new open work permit is available to people who applied for the new programs with a short validity in their current documents. Application for the permit closes on November 5th or until IRCC receives the maximum number of applications. The permit remains valid until December 31st, 2022.</p>



<p>According to IRCC, unless you are on maintained status or are eligible to restore your status, you apply up to four months before your current temporary status expires.</p>



<p>Applications are made online. However, IRCC accepts the paper application option if you have a disability or no internet connection.</p>



<h2>Steps to Apply for Canada’s New TR to PR Open Work Permit</h2>



<p>To apply, the steps you need to follow are as below:</p>



<h3>Step 1: Get the necessary t<strong>ools</strong></h3>



<p>This includes a camera or a scanner and your credit/debuts cards for payments. Also, you will need Adobe Acrobat Reader on your computer to view IRCC institution guides to help you fill out the forms.</p>



<h3>Step 2: Pay your fees</h3>



<p>The work permit extension fee costs $155 on the government website. You have to pay before applying online.</p>

<p>As 2019 has drawn to a close, another decade comes to an end and it is Nigeria’s 5th decade since her independence. Sadly, most of the buildings we celebrate till now are still the ones that defined our history leaving the architect short armed in his fight for relevance. People see a good/beautiful building and praise the client/owner but see a bad one and remember the architect. 2019 was a year where social media strongly questioned the architect’s role in our society. They conveniently ignored the shadows of clients, developers, building professionals and other issues over our collective failure and blamed only architects for the present state of our urban story. Remember it takes two to tango but presently, the work of one doesn’t hold value in the eyes of the other. If architecture shapes our lives and architects shape architecture, you know the rest. The architects work is not to draw, they are designers who create and shape the stage for the urban story of our lives to be told.<br></p>
