<p>The University of Ottawa has announced millions of scholarships for African students for the 2022/2023 Academic&nbsp; Year. The entrance and excellence scholarship will provide incoming students with a four-year scholarship to cover the partial cost of their university tuition.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Entrance &amp; Excellence Scholarship for African Students Studying in English&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The University of Ottawa is proud of the diversity of its international student body. This renewable scholarship is offered to international students who are citizens of African countries, who are admitted in the Fall 2022 term (September start date)&nbsp; or later with an admission average of 80% or higher, who are studying in English, and who enroll in one of the specified undergraduate programs in the faculties of Engineering, Science, or Social Sciences. This significant financial contribution to their education reduces their tuition fees by $17,500 &#8211; $25,000 for the excellent scholarships and by $12,000 &#8211; $20,000 for the entrance scholarships, depending on the program annually.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>All students who are eligible for this scholarship will automatically receive it upon enrolment. It will be applied directly to their tuition fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Entrance scholarship cannot be combined with the Excellence Scholarship for African Students Studying in English.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our scholarship program is one of the most generous in Canada. It rewards not only your pre-university academic achievements but also your achievements every term of full-time study at University. The new scholarship will give African students studying in English access to numerous pilot programs in three faculties for a significantly reduced cost of tuition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>In a bid to assist students throughout the application process, the University of Ottawa will host a number of virtual sessions to answer questions and guide prospective students on the application process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>All eligible students are considered for this award and will be notified at the time of their admission. Although no application is required for this scholarship, recipients will be asked to submit proof of citizenship of a country of territory in Africa before receiving their first installments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The application deadline for all 2022 nominations is on or before 1st April 2022.&nbsp;To get started fill out our chat widget and a representative would reach out to you.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Are you wondering if you can immigrate to Canada with a criminal record? A criminal record can exclude you from gaining permanent residence in Canada. Fortunately, you are not alone and there&#8217;s a way out of this.</p>



<p>Canada wants new permanent residents who can apply as skilled workers through Express Entry, however, there are strict rules laid out for people with criminal records for security purposes. In fact, as of 2018, a <a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/entering-canada-with-a-dui-conviction.html">driving under the influence</a> (DUI) conviction could easily make a potential migrant inadmissible to Canada forever for severe criminality. However, there is a way out and that&#8217;s through the <a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/immigration-criminality-rehabilitation.html">Criminal Rehabilitation</a> (CR) application.</p>



<h2><strong>What is Criminal Rehabilitation?</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/guide-5312-rehabilitation-persons-inadmissible-canada-past-criminal-activity.html">Criminal Rehabilitation</a> is a process devised to wipe your criminal record to make you admissible into Canada. It keeps your record permanently clean unless of course, you commit another crime.</p>



<p>Canada translates a person&#8217;s foreign criminal history into Canada&#8217;s equivalent to begin to deal with it. It could be translated based on serious and non-serious criminal offences, the processing fee costing CAD 1000 and CAD 200, respectively. Either way, you must be considered rehabilitated to receive your <a href="https://mapleeducation.ca/express-entry-pool/">Canadian PR</a> status.</p>



<p>However, you could have the option to apply for the Temporary Resident Permit (TRP) instead of the CR. While CR permanently clears your record and your TRP must be renewed else, you are still criminally inadmissible to Canada every time your TRP expires.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, CR is only obtainable for convictions outside of Canada. Otherwise, you may have to strive for a pardon from the Parole Board of Canada.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Are you wondering when you can enter the Express Entry pool? You&#8217;re definitely not the only one. There are many others as Canada is looking to welcome new immigrants. Express Entry is the most popular and quickest immigration pathway for individuals who desire to move to Canada to gain <a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/canadian-immigration-visas.html">Permanent Residence</a> (PR).</p>



<p>Canada plans to welcome more than 400,000 new immigrants every year. This was authorized under its 2021-2023 Immigration Levels Plan aimed at supporting its post-Covid economic recovery.</p>



<p>Out of the over 400,000 new immigrants moving to Canada for permanent residence, 60% will go as skilled workers and Express Entry is the main and fastest way skilled worker applications are processed in Canada.</p>



<h2><strong>When to Enter the Express Entry Pool</strong></h2>



<p>Most newly arrived in Canada successfully migrated through Express Entry via the <a href="https://mapleeducation.ca/federal-skilled-worker-program/">Federal Skilled Worker Program </a>(FSWP). To know when to enter the Express Entry pool, here are some things to do:</p>



<h3><strong>Find Out if You are Eligible for Canadian Immigration</strong></h3>



<p>Before you begin to apply, you must have read all the necessary requirements to be eligible for the FSW program. Find out if you are eligible.</p>



<p>Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, it was recorded that nearly half of the Express Entry immigrants were made up by the FSW program candidates. The other half came through the <a href="https://mapleeducation.ca/what-is-the-provincial-nominee-program/">Provincial Nominee Program</a> (PNP), Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP), and the <a href="https://mapleeducation.ca/what-is-the-canadian-experience-class/">Canadian Experience Class</a> (CEC). According to <a href="https://www.cicnews.com/2021/09/should-i-enter-canadas-express-entry-pool-now-0919231.html#gs.dl0fox">CIC news</a>, the IRCC has dispensed Express Entry invitations to PNP and CEC candidates since 2021. As a result, many FSWP candidates are waiting in the Express Entry pool. </p>



<p>Potential FSWP candidates might think it reasonable to wait for the IRCC to resume issuing Invitations to Apply (ITA) before they get into the pool. However, this would be a mistake. You can get in if you discover you are eligible.</p>



<h3><strong>Calculate Your Express Entry Score</strong></h3>



<p>Although it&#8217;s safe to enter the pool now, the only risk would be your official language test expiring within two years of completing the test if you do not receive an ITA.</p>



<p>It is a minimal risk compared to the reward of obtaining a Canadian PR, so, why not take the significantly rewarding risk?</p>



<p>At the risk of your language test expiring, you stand a higher chance of obtaining your PR when you enter the Express Entry pool than you do waiting for IRCC to resume issuing ITA.</p>



<h2><strong>Why You Should Enter the Express Entry Pool</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>You Won&#8217;t Be Caught Unaware</strong></h3>



<p>It is not certain when IRCC will resume issuing ITAs to FSW program candidates. The Express Entry pool is quite competitive and you don&#8217;t want to be caught unawares when the issuing of ITAs is resumed.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>You Receive an Additional 600 CRS points</strong></h3>



<p>You stand a chance of receiving a PNP invitation too. Accepting the invitation gives you an additional 600 CRS points which can guarantee an Express Entry ITA.</p>



<p>Provinces in Canada annually invite Express Entry candidates who meet their province&#8217;s labour market needs to apply to their PNP. Candidates who receive provincial nominations can apply to receive a provincial nomination certificate. Afterwards, they inform the IRCC to receive their additional 600 CRS points which increases their chances of receiving an ITA for PR in the next Express Entry draw that targets PNP candidates.</p>



<h3><strong>You can Create a Plus Account</strong></h3>



<p>Being in the Express Entry pool allows you to create a Plus Account in the Canadian government&#8217;s Job Bank. This access avails you of suitable employment opportunities and you could receive a job offer that will give you an additional 50 or 200 CRS points. Although these points do not outrightly get you an ITA, however, it increases your chances of getting it. </p>



<p>While you expect IRCC to resume issuing ITAs, it&#8217;s okay to sit on the fence about entering the Express Entry, however, it will be in your favour to do so. The Express Entry pool simply places you one step closer to obtaining your ITA for your PR in Canada.</p>

<p>Did you know that the Canadian passport is one of the most powerful passports in the world? Some passports are deemed more powerful than others. However, the strongest passports are the ones that offer the most outstanding travel freedom to travellers. In this article, you will understand the benefits of a Canadian passport.</p>



<p>While choosing travel destinations, travellers mostly consider destinations they can go to, what documents would be required before entry and the cost. Therefore, the world&#8217;s strongest passports are the ones that easily allow travellers into many countries without supplementary entry requirements like the visa.</p>



<h2><strong>Why the Canadian Passport is One of the Most Powerful</strong></h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.henleypassportindex.com/">Henley Passport Index</a>, a passport is ranked highly if it allows the holders entry into many countries with either of:</p>



<ul><li>Passport</li><li>Visa on arrival</li><li>Electronic travel authorization (eTA)/ online visa waiver.</li></ul>



<p>Using this criterion, Canadian passports are ranked in the 5th group of countries along with the United States, the United Kingdom, Malta, Greece, France, Hungary, Czech Republic, and Poland.</p>



<p>The Canadian passport is ranked 9th place in the most powerful passports in the world according to the <a href="https://www.passportindex.org/">Guide Passport Ranking Index</a>. This means that Canadian passport holders can travel to many world countries visa-free. Out of the existing 195 countries in the world, this <a href="https://visaindex.com/country/canada-passport-ranking/">report</a> shows that a Canadian passport holder can travel to 188 of them without a visa through passport only, a visa on arrival, or via an eTA.</p>



<p>In addition to providing free access to over 180 countries in the world, the Canadian passport is one of the most desirable passports in the world. The holders have free visa access and visa on arrival into countries such as:</p>



<ul><li>The United Kingdom</li><li>The United States</li><li>United Arab Emirates</li><li>Japan</li><li>European Union (the entire EU), etc.</li></ul>



<h2>It allows for instant worldwide travel opportunities for its holders.&nbsp;</h2>



<p>When entering Canada, holders of visa-free passports are required to obtain beforehand, an Electronic Travel Authorization. It costs $7CAD and it can be obtained online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, when flying into a country without visa restrictions, Canadian passport holders will likely be required to show their passports and some other documents such as:</p>



<ul><li>International travel insurance</li><li>Proof of accommodation</li><li>Proof of sufficient financial means</li><li>Countries such as Australia and New Zealand will require holders to submit their Electronic Travel Authorization.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Out of the 188 countries, Canadian passport holders can gain entry without visas, 45 of them will require that you apply for a visa on arrival. The documents that will be required includes:</p>



<ul><li>Passport (with at least, 6 months validity and at least, one blank visa page)</li><li>A proof showing your willingness to leave the country after your visa expires(a return travel ticket)</li><li>Proof of accommodation in your new visiting country (this could be a letter of invitation from a host or a hotel reservation).</li><li>You must demonstrate financial capability enough to cover your stay (<a href="https://mapleeducation.ca/nigeria-student-express-canada/">bank statements</a>)</li></ul>



<p>However, you won&#8217;t necessarily have to show these documents always. The demand for these <a href="https://mapleeducation.ca/canada-student-visa-application/">requirements </a>vary by country and for some, your passport and flight ticket is enough. </p>



<h2>Can I get into any country with a Canadian Passport?</h2>



<p>Canadian passport holders are required to obtain visas before they can get into about 41 destinations in the world. Some countries where visas are required for Canadian passport holders include:</p>



<ul><li>India</li><li>Turkey</li><li>China</li><li>Russia, etc.</li></ul>



<p>This <a href="https://visaindex.com/country/canada-passport-ranking/">report</a> shows that there are a total of 138 countries Canadians can visit without a visa, 45 Canada visas on arrival countries, and 5 eTA destinations.</p>



<p>So, now that you&#8217;ve learned the benefits of a Canadian Passport, what&#8217;s next?</p>

<p>Alberta is one of the Prairies Provinces in Western Canada. The province has a natural resource portfolio that consists of natural gas, minerals, coal, oil, and Alberta oil sands. This makes Alberta one of the fastest-growing economies in Canada and a popular destination for newcomers, who come looking for job opportunities through the Alberta Immigrant Nominee Program. </p>



<h2>Alberta Immigrant Nominee Program</h2>



<p>The Alberta Immigration Nominee Program (AINP) is one of Canada&#8217;s Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs). It is an economic immigration program that allows immigrants Permanent Residence (PR) in Alberta. Usually, these immigrants are foreign workers, students, or entrepreneurs interested in settling in Alberta permanently.</p>



<p>The program is designed for candidates with the skills, abilities, and experiences to benefit and fill labour shortages in Alberta. Or candidates looking to buy or start a new business in the province.</p>



<p>The Alberta government regulates this program in partnership with the <a href="https://mapleeducation.ca/ircc-launches-six-new-immigration-pathways/">IRCC</a>. To get nominated, candidates must apply for a nomination to the provincial government. If nominated, then the candidate may apply for PR to the federal government together with their spouse or children.</p>



<h2>Alberta Immigration Nominee Program (AINP) Streams</h2>



<p>This program offers five streams:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.alberta.ca/ainp-alberta-opportunity-stream.aspx">Opportunity stream</a></li><li><a href="https://www.alberta.ca/ainp-international-graduate-entrepreneur-immigration-stream.aspx">International graduate entrepreneur immigration stream</a></li><li>Express Entry stream</li><li>Foreign graduate startup visa stream</li><li>Self-employed farmer stream</li></ul>



<h3>Opportunity Stream:</h3>



<p>This stream offers an immigration pathway to foreign workers in the province. It requires that a candidate must already have a job offer in the province to be eligible.</p>



<h3>International Graduate Entrepreneur Immigration Stream (IGEIS)</h3>



<p>This stream is for students who have already completed post-secondary education in the province and wish to reside permanently. This can either be by buying or starting a new business.</p>



<h3><a href="https://www.alberta.ca/ainp-alberta-express-entry-stream.aspx"><strong>Express Entry stream</strong></a></h3>



<p>This stream requires that candidates must have an active Express Entry profile. They will be invited through their accounts with specific selection criteria. One of the major advantages of this stream is that candidates receive an additional 600 Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) points. Also, they receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for PR.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><a href="https://www.alberta.ca/ainp-foreign-graduate-start-up-visa-stream.aspx"><strong>Foreign Graduate Start-up Visa Stream (FGSVS)</strong></a></h3>



<p>This stream is specifically designed for candidates who have completed post-secondary education outside Canada but wish to reside in the province. To be eligible, candidates must be interested in starting a new business in the province.</p>



<h3><a href="https://www.alberta.ca/ainp-self-employed-farmer-stream.aspx"><strong>Self-Employed Farmer stream</strong></a></h3>



<p>This stream is for farmers who possess enough experience to buy or start a farm in the province.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What are the Eligibility Criteria of the Alberta Immigrant Nominee Program (AINP)</h2>



<p>The Alberta Immigrant Nominee Program (AINP) depends on the stream a candidate chooses. However, here is a list of the general criteria:</p>



<ul><li>A valid work permit earned through Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA)</li><li>Proof and status of temporary resident in Canada</li><li>Proof of work in an occupation accepted by AINP</li><li>Work experience for the job you want to apply</li><li>Proof of funds to settle in Canada</li><li>Language test results.

Or full-time work experience in 24 months in Canada within the past 30 months</li></ul>



<p>However, a valid work permit is not needed in these cases:</p>



<ul><li>When applicants have an LMIA exempt occupation</li><li>When applicants have a post-graduation work permit.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>What Documents are Required to Apply Under the Alberta Immigrant Nominee Program?</strong></h2>

<p>The Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) is an immigration program that allows applicants to live in a specific province, contribute to the province&#8217;s economy and gain permanent residence. It is an alternative to the <a href="https://mapleeducation.ca/federal-skilled-worker-program/">Canadian Federal Skilled Worker</a> visa.</p>



<p>It allows provinces and territories to meet the immigration needs of applicants. They do this by helping them fill in-demand jobs and meet labour shortages in the province.</p>



<h2>How Does the Provincial Nominee Program in Canada Work?</h2>



<p>Applicants with eligible Provincial Nomination will have the chance of getting an Invitation to Apply (ITA).</p>



<p>The Provincial Nominee Program in Canada offers these applicants who desire to reside in a specific Canadian province an immigration pathway permanently.</p>



<p>However, these provinces and territories have unique economic and demographic requirements applicants will need to meet. Also, each province or territory has its own streams and requirements to target specific groups of immigrants. The groups may be any of:</p>



<ul><li>Business people</li><li>Skilled workers</li><li>Semi-skilled workers</li><li>Students</li></ul>



<p>Meanwhile, most PNPs will require that applicants already have some connection in the province. The connection involves having previously studied or worked in the province. If not, they must have a job offer from an employer in the province for a job visa.</p>



<p>However, some PNPs do not require any previous connections. You have to apply directly and meet all requirements to gain enough CRS scores. The CRS score qualifies you to receive the Invitation to Apply (ITA). Once your application reaches the Express Entry pool, you will gain an additional CRS score when applying for a PR visa. The minimum CRS score for Express Entry is 692.</p>



<p>Ideally, the program is specifically designed for candidates who cannot meet the minimum criteria to qualify for the PR visa of Canada. Also, candidates who cannot score enough CRS to receive an Invitation to Apply to the Express Entry pool.</p>



<h2><strong>How Can I Get PNP in Canada?</strong></h2>



<p>To get the PNP in Canada, you must meet the set requirements for applicants. Although the documents required for the PNP depends on the specific qualifying standards, there are some essential documents required:</p>



<ul><li>Valid passport</li><li>Recent color photographs</li><li>Identity proof</li><li>General application form of the principal applicant</li><li>Attested documents by the spouse and other dependents</li><li>Documents supporting the spouse and other dependents</li><li>Language skills results</li><li>Educational Credential Assessment (ECA) report</li><li>Police clearance</li><li>Medical certificate</li><li>Proof of fund.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Provincial Nominee Programs Process in Canada</strong></h2>



<p>There are two ways you can apply for the PNP in Canada:</p>



<ul><li>Express Entry System</li><li>Non-Express Entry System</li></ul>



<h3><strong>The Express Entry System can be Processed in Two Ways</strong>:</h3>



<p>The applicants create an Express Entry Profile and reach the Express Entry pool after submitting the necessary documents. The different provinces and territories then pick their suitable applicants, and they are sent the Notification of Interest (NOI). Applicants who receive the NOI can send their Expression of Interest (EOI) to the Express Entry.</p>



<p>In the second way to the Express Entry System, the applicants will check for suitable PNPs and apply for the nomination. They can create the Express Entry profile when the province or territory they applied to agrees for a nomination. There they can show that they have the provincial nomination.</p>



<h3><strong>Non- Express Entry System</strong>:</h3>



<p>The Non-Express Entry System is a paper-based application. The applicants will have to select a suitable province whose eligibility requirements they best meet. They submit the EOI under the non-Entry Express stream. Their application will be assessed based on the point system of the particular territory or province. The selected applicants will receive a nomination letter. Afterward, they must submit a paper application for Permanent Residency (PR) visa to the Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).</p>



<h2><strong>Which PNP is Best in Canada?</strong></h2>



<p>All PNP in Canada is great and unique. The best and easiest will depend on the applicants and their areas of expertise. However, here are the best three:</p>



<h3><strong>Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP):</strong></h3>



<p>This program offers numerous tech job opportunities. It consists of categories to easily allow skilled workers, graduates, and business owners to migrate to Canada.</p>



<p>To apply to this program, you must have a minimum CRS score of 400 points and higher. Also, the program offers streams for both French-speaking Skilled Workers and Skilled Trades Stream.</p>



<h3><strong>Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program (SINP):</strong></h3>



<p>This PNP program offers a broad range of occupations. Applicants who have had difficulties under the Express Entry system will find this program much more accessible.</p>



<p>To qualify, you have to:</p>



<ul><li>Have at most minor, one-year work experience in any jobs in Saskatchewan&#8217;s in-demand occupations</li><li>Have completed your education up to post-secondary level</li><li>Be proficient in either English or French language</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Nova Scotia Nominee Program (NSNP):</strong></h3>



<p>This program offers various options to entrepreneurs, skilled workers, international graduates, and temporary foreign workers.</p>



<p>To qualify to apply, you must have an active Express Entry profile. Also, you must have a job offer from an employer in the province. There&#8217;s another option for candidates who have experience in any of the in-demand occupations in the province. These options are Categories A and B, respectively.</p>



<h2><strong>How Much Does it Cost for PNP Canada?</strong></h2>
