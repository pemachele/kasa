Violent crime is extremely rare and gun ownership is almost four times lower than the US. This has boosted Canada\u2019s global reputation and in 2014, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Better Life Index awarded Canada an impressive 9.7 out of 10 for safety and security. Gun ownership is lower partly because Canadians simply feel safer. The process of obtaining a license and firearm is also lengthy and stringent, particularly when compared to the US.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-12efca95 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"12efca95\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Education Matters<\/strong><br \/>Canada values education and has long ensured all young citizens have access to the best schooling available no matter their background. The government spends more per capita on education than other countries in the world. As a result, Canadian children perform well across the board and on average, stay in education longer than most other countries. This, in turn, has created a well informed, well paid society that still offers great career opportunities for skilled expats.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-e8dd0f6 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"e8dd0f6\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p><strong>The Society Is Tolerant and Open-Minded<\/strong><br \/>Canada\u2019s relaxed and liberal reputation is well earned. It has long been a pioneer of civil rights and was the first country outside Europe to legalize same sex marriage over a decade ago. Canada\u2019s multicultural, diverse spirit is evident in both its forward thinking immigration policy and its zero tolerance approach to hate crimes and racial abuse. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has even named it the best country in the world for acceptance and tolerance of minorities. Canada has long realized the benefits that skilled immigrants can bring to their country and, in particular, their economy. Their sensible and fair immigration policy gives anyone truly willing to make a successful life in Canada a good chance of achieving their goals. As a result, Canadians are able to travel the world relatively freely, safe in the knowledge that they will be welcomed wherever they go.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-d2dad3f elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"d2dad3f\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p><strong>The Country Is Big and Beautiful<\/strong><br \/>With almost 10 million square kilometers of stunning countryside, Canada is the second largest country in the world and undoubtedly one of the most beautiful. From snow sprinkled peaks to sparkling lakes and vast woodlands, Canada can take your breath away at every turn. Every weekend and holiday will be packed with skiing, whale watching, kayaking and hiking around this spectacular wilderness. For a more unique experience, how about swimming with a polar bear or sleeping in an ice hotel? You can do it all in Canada. Toronto was recently named the fourth most attractive city in the world, proving that even the cities are pretty in Canada. With a relatively small population of just 35 million spread across this vast country, there\u2019s plenty of room and reasonably priced housing almost everywhere.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-33e5bfb elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"33e5bfb\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p><strong>The Country Is Naturally Rich<\/strong><br \/>Canada\u2019s stable economy is built on the strong foundations of its natural wealth. As well as a large income from the oil and gas industry, gold, copper, iron ore and uranium all contribute to the country\u2019s impressive GDP. The rich central plains are ideal for farming and allow Canada to export substantial amounts of wheat and other cereals as well as wood and lumber products. Canada\u2019s natural wealth has also benefited its booming tourist industry as people flock from all over the world to see elk, polar bears and whales and perhaps even catch a glimpse of the Northern Lights. With over 250,000 immigrants settling here every year, Canada is clearly an idyllic destination for any potential expat.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-50 elementor-inner-column elementor-element elementor-element-5cfba853\" data-id=\"5cfba853\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-52c2942 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"52c2942\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Canada Is A Multicultural Melting Pot<\/strong><br \/>Canada\u2019s Anglo-French culture was ingrained in the national identity from its conception. So, it is no surprise that today it is one of the most diverse nations in the world. 41 of Canada\u2019s 338 members of parliament were born overseas ensuring tolerance and multiculturalism are promoted and protected at the heart of government. You cannot walk down a street in Toronto or Vancouver without hearing a foreign tongue being spoken or catching the scent of some tempting international cuisine. For an expat, it is easy to settle into life in Canada as acceptance and respect are very much a part of national psyche. If you are willing to get out, meet new people and embrace your new country, Canada is ready to embrace you.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-4f8f57c elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"4f8f57c\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Economic Strength and Stability<\/strong><br \/>The postcard images of spectacular lakes and mountains are undoubtedly alluring, but anyone moving overseas must consider the practical and financial benefits of any possible destination. Luckily, Canada has one of the strongest economies in the world and has a huge variety of career options for any ambitious expat. Canada\u2019s banking system is the bedrock of its strong, secure economy and has been voted the most stable on the planet for seven consecutive years by the World Economic Forum. This financial security allows Canada to offer a good quality of life for the vast majority of residents and has the second highest standard of living of all the G20 nations.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-4c15871 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"4c15871\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Canadians Have A Good Sense of Humour<\/strong><br \/>While Canadians are generally a proud, patriotic bunch, they know not to take themselves too seriously.

Waves of immigration from Europe, Asia and South America have enhanced and enriched Canada\u2019s restaurant scene. In most big cities you will find a huge variety of international cuisine, from Vietnamese and Thai to Iranian and Lebanese.
