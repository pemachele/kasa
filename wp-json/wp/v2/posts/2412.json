According to W.H.O, there are more than 132,000 cases of Corona-virus with the death toll reaching up to 5000 persons. W.H.O declared the outbreak of the disease a pandemic. This resulted in Italy tightened its strict quarantine rules and the USA imposing a ban on flights from Europe, with an exception of England and Ireland. So how does the coronavirus impact Canada and student admissions?<\/p>\n<p>There are over 63 Countries affected by the pandemic virus, and Canada has been recorded as one of the infected countries. According to WHO, The Great White North has recorded 690 confirmed cases with Nine people dead from the virus. Since the outbreak, the Canadian Authorities: The Public Health Agency of Canada &#8211; along with public health authorities at all levels of government across the country \u2013 have been working tirelessly to ensure the pandemic is curtailed in the country.<\/p>\n<p><b>CORONAVIRUS: NIGERIA TO CANADA.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>After, several speculations, invocations and finally convictions, the life-threatening disease has finally found its way through to Africa, crossing different borders to Nigeria. The populace has become disturbed and bewildered over the past few days and rightly so with the devastating rate at which the virus is wiping out humanity.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/ncdc.gov.ng\/news\/227\/first-case-of-corona-virus-disease-confirmed-in-nigeria\">first case of the pandemic<\/a> was recorded on the 24th of February when an Italian citizen who entered our beloved country on a Turkish Airline from Milan via Istanbul. According to the Lagos Commissioner for Health, Professor Akin Abayomi, there are new cases of the Pandemic COVID-19 in Lagos. It is traumatizing to know that COVID-19 is here in Nigeria, one cannot even begin to imagine what havoc the deadly virus is wreaking. To further confirm our greatest fear, there have been 12 recorded cases with one person dying from the virus. Although, the Nigerian government has started taking an expeditious move to arrest the spread of the disease which has become a global threat.<\/p>\n<p>In view of this, restriction to the country has been placed by the Federal government to the travellers from 13 countries who have reported 1,000 cases of the pandemic including the United Kingdom and the USA leaving Canada out of the blacklisted countries.<\/p>\n<p>As a part of the preventive measures against the spread of the virus, the federal has announced the closing of all public and private secondary schools and varsities in Nigeria from Monday, March 23, 2020. The move is to prevent both teacher and school from being vulnerable to the life-threatening disease and to practice social distancing. Consequently, an agreement was made with religious leaders to ban religious gathering more than 50 worshipers to curtail the spread of this deadly virus.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of the mitigation strategy to limit the spread of COVID -19, The Nigerian High Commission Canada will proceed with issuing Emergency Travel Certificate (ETC) and visas to those who need to travel urgently.<\/p>\n<p><b>CAN CORONAVIRUS AFFECT MY ADMISSION AND VISA PROCESSING?\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>With the new travel restriction imposed by the Canadian government, there have been huge concerns whether admissions and visa processing to Canadian institutions are still ongoing for both summer and fall intake. As a reputable Canadian Immigration Consulting firm, we will be shedding more light on information reaching us from Canada and our affiliate institutions concerning the COVID-19 and your entry to Canada in general.<\/p>\n<p>According to the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, all international visitors to Canada who are non-Canadian citizens or permanent residents will be turned around at the airport except for Americans, Diplomats and flight crew. This is a conscious effort by the government to curb contact between people, and hopefully stem community transmission of the virus. Regardless of how long Coronavirus is willing to stay, admission and visa processing are still ongoing for September intake. <b>The million-dollar question at this point is, how is this possible?\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Students may be able to take classes online if the travel ban continues until May. If you have a valid study permit for a May start date, you might have to defer admission to a later date or seek advice from your institution immediately. However, there is a need to confirm that your institution adapts to the changes. In spite of the global uncertainty surrounding education, you will have access to course notes from your intended program of study as well as any support you require.<\/p>\n<p><b>HOW CAN I APPLY FOR MY ADMISSION DURING THIS TIME?\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>If you have started your <a href=\"https:\/\/mapleeducation.ca\/study-in-canada-from-nigeria\/\">admission processing<\/a> or on the verge of kicking off this process, there is nothing to worry about. We understand the importance of social distancing and the need to stay safe during this period. Consequently, we have shifted all physical presence online for us to attend to your needs, and also to ensure your safety. You can always send a mail of inquiry to our admission team concerning your application to your preferred institution. Preferably, see contact details if you would like to speak to any member of our team for assistance. At Maple Education Canada, your safety is paramount to us, therefore, we advise that you stay safe this period.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Corona-virus pandemic plaguing the world is not a pleasant tale and is currently leaving behind a lot of chaos.
