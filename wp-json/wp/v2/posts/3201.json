Here are 6 benefits of studying in Canada:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><strong>You will have access to easy and friendly immigration pathways<\/strong><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The immigration process to Canada is not tedious as long as you have all the necessary requirements. For Nigerians, Canada introduced<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cicnews.com\/2020\/03\/canada-introduces-program-to-fast-track-study-permit-processing-from-nigeria-0313846.html#gs.us93lv\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 The Nigeria Student Express (NSE),<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a pilot initiative for Nigerians who have been accepted to a Canadian post-secondary institution. The NSE effectively shortens the time frame of getting a study permit from an average of eight weeks to 20 days.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><strong>You will get to experience a high quality of education<\/strong><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Studying in Canada gives you the chance to experience one of the highest quality of education in the world. The education standards they adhere to is why it\u2019s a choice country of study for most international students. You can rest assured that you will be armed with a globally recognised certificate and will be qualified for jobs anywhere in the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><strong>Canada is well known for its affordable tuition costs<\/strong><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many international students, the highlight of studying in Canada is the low tuition cost. For the same quality of education in the US and UK, you will be spending a lower amount. When you also consider the lower cost of accommodation and living expenses, you will be getting a better deal. As an international student, you are also eligible for a number of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.educanada.ca\/scholarships-bourses\/non_can\/index.aspx?lang=eng\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">scholarships opportunities<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to support you through your education.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3>You will experience a diverse culture<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canada is home to people from different nationalities and religions. It is culturally diverse and has English and French as their official languages. Though language barriers are often a concern when moving to a foreign country, that will not be a problem for Nigerians. When it comes to safety, Canada is one of the safest countries in the world with a safety index of 58.12.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span>You will have access to work opportunities<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike most countries where there are severe restrictions on being a student and also having a job, it&#8217;s easier to work and study in Canada. There is a high availability of job opportunities both for those who are still in school and for those who want to move there to work and live.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>You&#8217;ll have the opportunity to stay in Canada after graduation<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You also have the opportunity of becoming a permanent resident after your studies in Canada. Also, there&#8217;s room and encouragement for you to stay back and build a life in the country.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Entry requirements for Canadian universities for Nigerians<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are varying entry requirements to Canadian universities depending on your stage of education and the school you\u2019ve chosen. If you decide to study in Canada from Nigeria, here is the standard process of making your dream come true:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3>Select a school<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first step is to choose a course\/program of study. Then you\u2019ll need to find a university or college that offers your program. You can check out our list of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mapleeducation.ca\/affiliated-institutions\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">affiliated schools<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Canada offers a variety of degrees and courses, so you will most likely find one that suits your needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3>Get the necessary documents ready<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most schools have their own specific documents that will be requested when you apply so ensure you find that out. Check out this <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mapleeducation.ca\/study-in-canada\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">comprehensive checklist of documents that will be requested to study in Canada<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for undergraduates and those going for postgraduate programmes.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><strong>Apply to your school of choice<\/strong><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next step is to send in your application to your school of choice and wait for an offer letter. Once you get this, you can then move to the next step!<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><strong>Apply for your visa<\/strong><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, apply for your visa and study permit. It&#8217;s essential that you start this application as soon as you receive your offer letter because international students cannot stay in Canada without the required visa.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>How you can get a speedy admission to a prestigious school in Canada<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We encourage applicants to begin the process at least one year or more ahead. This is to provide you with ample opportunity to prepare and move from one phase to the next. You could choose to do the research yourself and spend your time with it. Maple Education Canada has built a relationship with their affiliate schools over a decade of helping students get into their school of choice. It makes it possible to offer prospective students a speedy application process. We are also able to ensure quality documentation through certified Canadian Immigration Consultants that are always up-to-date on current immigration processes and information.
