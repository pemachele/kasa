The country offers Nigerians over a hundred economic-class immigration programs to select from. Nigerians who want to move to Canada can leverage this to school, work or gain permanent residence in Canada. In 2019, a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cicnews.com\/2020\/02\/a-quarter-of-canadas-immigrants-arrived-from-india-in-2019-0213700.html#gs.y8vfbr\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">whopping thirteen thousand<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nigerians obtained permanent residency. This is because Canada\u2019s economic class programs, and the fact that Nigeria is an English-speaking country, give Nigerians an edge in the application process. Do you ever wonder what it will cost you to relocate to Canada from Nigeria? Keep reading this article to find out.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>What does it cost to relocate to Canada from Nigeria?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Canada offers opportunities in sectors that appeal to Nigerians and can improve their quality of life. <a href=\"https:\/\/mapleeducation.ca\/study-in-canada-from-nigeria\/\">ICT, oil and gas, health care, and other STEM-related<\/a> fields are a few among the country&#8217;s established sectors. There are also various pathways available to study, work or live in Canada like the <a href=\"https:\/\/mapleeducation.ca\/nigeria-student-express-canada\/\">Nigeria Student Express program<\/a> that helps Nigerian students get their student visas faster. And compared to countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, moving to Canada is relatively affordable. But how much exactly does it cost to relocate to Canada from Nigeria?<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The amount depends on whether you&#8217;re relocating alone or with your family. And unless you have a job waiting for you in Canada, you&#8217;ll need enough money to keep you afloat. At least until you get settled. This is why the Canadian government requires those applying for permanent residence to have a certain amount in their bank account. Your immigration pathway also affects the cost to move to Canada from Nigeria:<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3>Provincial Nomination Programs (PNPs)<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eleven provincial and territorial governments manage PNPs in Canada. Each of these provinces and territories decides its processing or application fees. If you&#8217;re nominated for PNP, the amount you pay for processing will then be added to the cost of your permanent resident application. Getting a PNP nomination boosts your chances of immigration considerably.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The settlement fund for PNP differs by province. To qualify for nomination, you must meet the settlement funds requirement of that particular province. Click on\u00a0 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aptechvisa.com\/ontario-provincial-nominee-program-oinp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ontario<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aptechvisa.com\/sinp-saskatchewan-settlement-plans-funds-requirement\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saskatchewan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for their settlement funds. Then when you get a nomination, you need to match the IRCC settlement fund.

Add that same amount to the initial \u20a64,877,328.8797 to make it \u20a65,932,899.5303 if you have an additional family member. The calculation goes on in that vein. However, note that this is subject to change every year. Whether your spouse or children are relocating with you to Canada or not, your savings must reflect their own share.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Processing Express Entry profile does not require a fee.
