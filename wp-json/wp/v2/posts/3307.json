It requires a lot of preparation and making sure all legally required documents are available and submitted. However, there are factors that can deny you entry into Canada and you need to be aware of them. Being aware of these factors will save you time and money and ensure your move is stress-free.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this article, we share 11 factors that can deny you entry into Canada.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>11 factors that can deny you entry into Canada<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two broad categories of inadmissibility in Canada. The first category is known as criminal inadmissibility and the second as medical inadmissibility. Anything that falls outside these two categories is classified under Others. Criminal offences\u2014minor or major, old or recent\u2014are all classified under criminal inadmissibility. Similarly, all health issues fall under medical inadmissibility. Under the following categories, we discuss factors that can deny you entry into Canada.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Medical inadmissibility<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Subsection 38(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) makes provision for this. A medical officer will look at your official medical documentation and also assess your health before entry. The following fall under this category.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3>Potential to require excessive health or social service<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a medical condition that requires a lot of health or social services is grounds for medical inadmissibility. This is because Canada does everything it can not to put too much strain on its healthcare system. So you should probably expect not to be admitted if you have one such condition. Your common-law partner or spouse is exempt from this clause. Even those with such a condition can also find a way around it. This medical inadmissibility can be excused if you apply for Temporary Resident Permit (TRP through your lawyer. You can also apply for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/corporate\/publications-manuals\/operational-bulletins-manuals\/permanent-residence\/humanitarian-compassionate-consideration\/processing.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">humanitarian and compassionate discretion (H&amp;C).<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This takes public policies into account and offsprings directly affected.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3>Health risk to the public<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the things the medical officer will check is whether you have an infectious condition. Or whether your existing condition has the potential to put the Canadian public in any kind of danger. You may be inadmissible if you have schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. These two conditions can cause irrational behaviour or violent outbursts, which puts the public in danger. Influenza, hepatitis, and measles are all communicable diseases and are grounds for inadmissibility.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Criminal inadmissibility<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Criminal inadmissibility is the most common reason for inadmissibility. Canada takes crime very seriously, past or present, minor or major. Even if the crime happened in a foreign national\u2019s home country. Below are some factors that might make you inadmissible under this category.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3>Human rights violations<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;ve ever been involved in any human rights violation, you may be inadmissible to enter Canada. People frequently found to be guilty of gross human right violations are mostly top government officials. Especially those who served in internationally sanctioned governments.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3>Organised crime<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Present or past involvement in organised crime is grounds for inadmissibility into Canada. Some examples include being a past or current member of a mafia, terrorist group, gang, or other organised crime groups.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3>Past criminal conviction<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyone convicted of any past criminal offence may be denied entry at the port. To be denied entry under this category, you must\u2019ve been convicted of a crime considered illegal in your home country and Canada. Some examples include manslaughter, reckless driving, assault, theft, and drug possession.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Other kinds of inadmissibility<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3>Misrepresentation<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Misrepresentation includes a wide range of things. Withholding or skewing information that prevents or affects the full enforcement of the Canadian immigration laws is considered misrepresentation. Forging a signature is a misrepresentation. So is changing your date of birth or marital status to take advantage of a particular class to migrate. You could go to jail or get a two-year ban from Canada if you&#8217;re found guilty of misrepresentation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3>Potential to overstay<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You could be denied entry to Canada on the suspicion that you might overstay. Officials suspect this if there&#8217;s evidence that you overstayed in the country before. Overstaying means being in the country after the expiration of your visa.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3>Travelling with an inadmissible family member<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Travelling with a family member who&#8217;s inadmissible will automatically make you inadmissible too. That family member might be inadmissible for any of the reasons above. A Canadian official will determine this.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3>Noncompliance with any provisions of the IRA<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Failure to comply with any of IRA&#8217;s provisions makes you inadmissible to enter Canada. Trying to re-enter the country unauthorised after deportation is a noncompliance issue. Likewise, studying in Canada without proper permits or failure to meet residency obligations as a permanent resident. A Removal Order is usually issued for cases of noncompliance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of solutions, cases of inadmissibility can be reversed. If you&#8217;re issued a Removal Order, you may return to the country by applying for an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/inadmissibility\/reasons\/authorization-return-canada.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Authorization to Return to Canada (ARC)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> document. Note that the ARC will not be issued unless you pay the government back for removal costs. For criminal inadmissibility, you may go for Criminal Rehabilitation. You can only qualify for this five years after committing the offence. Once you complete the rehabilitation, you&#8217;ll be free to enter Canada without having to apply for a Temporary Resident Permit every time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Do you need help with applying for a Canadian residence visa?
