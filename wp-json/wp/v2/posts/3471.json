The IELTS raises a lot of concerns for international students. While those from English-speaking countries think it&#8217;s unfair. Others think it&#8217;s too expensive.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">English is Canada&#8217;s first official language, with French being the second. This is why the Canadian government places a high value on the IELTS, a way to test your English proficiency of foreign nationals. The government wants to be sure that you&#8217;re equipped with a good command of the English language to enable you to communicate sufficiently with the locals. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the absence of English language, the government expects you to know how to speak French at least. But what if you don&#8217;t want to take the English language test or the French language test? Does that mean you have no chance of migrating to Canada?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Keep reading to learn what your options are.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Move to Canada Without IELTS<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below are ways to move to Canada without IELTS.&nbsp;<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3>Look for Universities that Don&#8217;t Require IELTS<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To study in Canada without taking the IELTS, you have to look for universities that don&#8217;t require it. It&#8217;s the universities that usually require English proficiency tests, not the Canadian embassy. So if you can find a university that doesn&#8217;t require international students to produce the IELTS certificate, you have a chance of studying in Canada. You can conduct a search on Google. Meanwhile, some of the top Canadian universities that don&#8217;t require IELTS include the University of Regina, Carleton University, University of Winnipeg, Cambrian College, University of Saskatchewan, and Seneca College, Toronto.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3>Get the English Proficiency Certificate<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Universities in Canada now offer international students a different route. Instead of taking the IELTS, you can simply provide an English proficiency certificate. This is easy to obtain. If you studied in a school where you were taught in English, simply request your certificate and use it as proof of English proficiency. With this, you don&#8217;t have to go through the rigors of taking the IELTS.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3>Take an Online English Language Course<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main reasons most Nigerians don&#8217;t like taking the IELTS is that it&#8217;s expensive. Not to talk of all the preparation required to take the exams successfully. When one considers that Nigeria is an English-speaking country, the need for IELTS diminishes further. You can take an online English language course online instead of IELTS. It is easier than the IELTS, plus it doesn&#8217;t have a standard required for a pass. All you need is the certificate as proof of English language proficiency. Search online and you&#8217;d find plenty of sites offering <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fluentu.com\/blog\/english\/online-english-courses\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">English language courses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><b>Apply for Canada Work Permit<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not many people know that you can apply for a Canadian Work Permit without IELTS. As previously mentioned, the IELTS is simply a way to test if you know the language enough to communicate with others while you&#8217;re in the country. All you need to travel to Canada for work is your work permit. To get a Canadian Work Permit, you need to secure a job offer from your Canadian employer. This is where things get a little trick, though. If your employer doesn&#8217;t ask for your IELTS score, then you&#8217;re through. Fortunately, many employers don&#8217;t ask for it.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Canada is an attractive destination for many Nigerians. The country offers quality education, affordable healthcare, and a good standard of living. The IELTS gives you options and boosts your chances of immigrating to Canada.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How Maple Education Can Help You Study, Work, and Live in Canada<\/h2>\n<p>At Maple Education, we&#8217;ve helped over 7,000 clients fulfill their dreams to study, work and live in Canada.<\/p>\n<p>Our clients often come to us feeling unprepared for the IELTS and go on to achieve great scores to move forward.
