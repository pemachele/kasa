While students know this, not many have a good grasp of how they work and what differentiates them. Most of the resources online focus more on Master&#8217;s Degree and PhD, so the former seems like the only natural step after undergraduate studies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But each student&#8217;s situation and goals call for a different approach, and a postgraduate diploma can also serve a need. It is an option for an individual who doesn&#8217;t want something time-intensive or research-focused. Those whose situation changed halfway through their Master&#8217;s Degree can find a postgraduate diploma helpful. Instead of simply dropping out altogether, they can recourse to a post-graduate diploma. The same thing applies to anyone who finds out halfway through their Master&#8217;s Degree that dissertation isn&#8217;t their thing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What Is the Difference Between a Postgraduate and Master&#8217;s Degree?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are some of the differences between a Master&#8217;s Degree and a Postgraduate Diploma.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>A Masters Degree is a Longer Qualification<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Though a Masters Degree and a Postgraduate Diploma are on the same academic level, the former is a more extended qualification. When studying full-time, a Masters degree takes one year to complete, the modules worth 180 credits. In contrast, a postgraduate diploma takes two terms, with modules worth 120 credits. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.postgraduatesearch.com\/advice\/pgdip-pgcert\/what-is-a-postgraduate-certificate\/ap-63595\/%3famp=true\">Postgraduate certificates<\/a> last just one term, with modules worth 60 credits only. Each surpasses the next with modules worth 60 credits.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Postgraduate Diplomas are Vocational<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Postgraduate diplomas are vocational. This means postgraduate diplomas focus on helping students acquire practical skills and specific skills in their chosen field. While a Masters degree involves completing a series of modules and writing a dissertation. You may be better off with a postgraduate diploma if you&#8217;re looking to go into journalism or <a href=\"https:\/\/mapleeducation.ca\/study-law-in-canada-for-nigerian-students\/\">law<\/a>. Usually, postgraduate diplomas give you access to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-service-commission\/jobs\/services\/recruitment\/students\/federal-student-work-program.html\">work programs<\/a> that allow you to gain some experience while studying. But if you&#8217;re looking to become a professor or a researcher, a masters degree aligns better with your goals.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>A Master&#8217;s Degree Requires an Undergraduate Degree<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can&#8217;t go for a masters degree without having an undergraduate degree or equivalent title. It&#8217;s different with a postgraduate diploma. Some programs grant admission to students without an undergraduate degree as long as they have professional experience in their chosen fields. Additionally, a masters degree can be specific to a university. But all graduate diplomas are always university-specific.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Master&#8217;s Degrees are More Expensive<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Importantly, money is another significant differentiator. A masters degree is quite expensive compared to a postgraduate diploma. Many people find a postgraduate diploma more affordable. Individuals enrolled in a postgraduate diploma can easily take career breaks because of their length. If they wish, postgraduate diploma students can also combine their academic pursuit with their current job.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, being research-based, a masters degree allows you to contribute knowledge to the world through your research, insights, and discoveries. In addition, you can pursue further education like a PHD with your Master&#8217;s degree. Your chances of gaining recognition and applause are high. While a postgraduate diploma enables you to acquire a qualification that can quickly enhance your career in any particular field.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maple Education Canada has the best educational consultants in the country.
