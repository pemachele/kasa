Also, Halifax, Quebec City, Ottawa, Winnipeg and Edmonton airports will begin to accept international flights. Canada will end its hotel quarantine starting August 9, although travellers may be subject to random testing at the border.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For fully vaccinated travellers from all countries who have received their final dosage of vaccine injection at least 14days before entry, Canada will reopen\\ its borders from September 7. Before entry into Canada, all travellers are expected to submit their documents to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/diseases\/coronavirus-disease-covid-19\/arrivecan.html\">ArriveCAN app or website<\/a>. Here&#8217;s a list of vaccine manufacturers accepted by Canada:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Astra<\/li><li>Pfizer<\/li><li>Zeneca<\/li><li>Moderna<\/li><li>Janssen (Johnsons &amp; Johnsons)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Though it doesn&#8217;t matter which country travellers get their vaccines, the results must be presented in either English or French. If not, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cicnews.com\/2021\/07\/certified-translation-for-immigration-to-canada-what-you-need-to-know-0718410.html\">certified translations<\/a> will need to be provided for border officials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The unvaccinated dependents (children under 12) of fully vaccinated travellers will be subject to all entry and testing requirements, including on-arrival testings. Also, they are recommended to avoid group settings such as schools and daycares in the two weeks following their arrival in Canada. However, territories and provinces may have their own set rules around people who recently returned from travel. The government will update more on this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Requirements to be allowed entry into Canada<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting August 9, Canadian citizens and <a href=\"https:\/\/mapleeducation.ca\/express-entry-canada\/\">permanent residents<\/a> travelling to the US for less than 72 hours will be fully vaccinated and can do their pre-entry arrival test in Canada. They won&#8217;t have to take a second test to be allowed back into Canada. Also, they won&#8217;t need a post-arrival test in the US, and no charges to mandatory testing will be required for unvaccinated dependents of fully vaccinated travellers. Although, they will still be subjected to undergo the on-arrival tests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To confirm proof of vaccination, starting August 9, air carriers through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/diseases\/coronavirus-disease-covid-19\/arrivecan.html\">ArriveCAN<\/a> will verify travellers have submitted their information before boarding. Airlines will accept the travellers&#8217; receipts either on their mobile phones or a printed copy. However, travellers are recommended to have their original vaccine certificate to show officials at the border.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of travellers who can not be fully vaccinated due to health conditions, they may be qualified for eased quarantine requirements and may be asked to follow a modified quarantine plan. This is the same for travellers arriving in Canada by boat only if they meet the requirements for fully vaccinated travellers and have done the pre-entry testing through ArriveCAN.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These new measures do not start to take effect until August 9 at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, government officials announced Canada would be prolonging its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cicnews.com\/2021\/07\/canada-to-provide-update-today-on-india-flight-travel-0718641.html\">ban on direct flights to India<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http:\/\/cicnews.com\">CIC News<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@joaccord?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Joshua Oluwagbemiga<\/a> on <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/s\/photos\/black-man-in-suit?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>According to CIC news, Canada will reopen its borders to fully vaccinated tourists from the US starting August 9.
