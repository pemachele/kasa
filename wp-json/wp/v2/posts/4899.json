It is an alternative to the <a href=\"https:\/\/mapleeducation.ca\/federal-skilled-worker-program\/\">Canadian Federal Skilled Worker<\/a> visa.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It allows provinces and territories to meet the immigration needs of applicants. They do this by helping them fill in-demand jobs and meet labour shortages in the province.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Does the Provincial Nominee Program in Canada Work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants with eligible Provincial Nomination will have the chance of getting an Invitation to Apply (ITA).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Provincial Nominee Program in Canada offers these applicants who desire to reside in a specific Canadian province an immigration pathway permanently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, these provinces and territories have unique economic and demographic requirements applicants will need to meet. Also, each province or territory has its own streams and requirements to target specific groups of immigrants. The groups may be any of:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Business people<\/li><li>Skilled workers<\/li><li>Semi-skilled workers<\/li><li>Students<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, most PNPs will require that applicants already have some connection in the province. The connection involves having previously studied or worked in the province. If not, they must have a job offer from an employer in the province for a job visa.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, some PNPs do not require any previous connections. You have to apply directly and meet all requirements to gain enough CRS scores. The CRS score qualifies you to receive the Invitation to Apply (ITA). Once your application reaches the Express Entry pool, you will gain an additional CRS score when applying for a PR visa. The minimum CRS score for Express Entry is 692.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally, the program is specifically designed for candidates who cannot meet the minimum criteria to qualify for the PR visa of Canada. Also, candidates who cannot score enough CRS to receive an Invitation to Apply to the Express Entry pool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How Can I Get PNP in Canada?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To get the PNP in Canada, you must meet the set requirements for applicants. Although the documents required for the PNP depends on the specific qualifying standards, there are some essential documents required:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Valid passport<\/li><li>Recent color photographs<\/li><li>Identity proof<\/li><li>General application form of the principal applicant<\/li><li>Attested documents by the spouse and other dependents<\/li><li>Documents supporting the spouse and other dependents<\/li><li>Language skills results<\/li><li>Educational Credential Assessment (ECA) report<\/li><li>Police clearance<\/li><li>Medical certificate<\/li><li>Proof of fund.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Provincial Nominee Programs Process in Canada<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways you can apply for the PNP in Canada:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Express Entry System<\/li><li>Non-Express Entry System<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Express Entry System can be Processed in Two Ways<\/strong>:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The applicants create an Express Entry Profile and reach the Express Entry pool after submitting the necessary documents. The different provinces and territories then pick their suitable applicants, and they are sent the Notification of Interest (NOI). Applicants who receive the NOI can send their Expression of Interest (EOI) to the Express Entry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second way to the Express Entry System, the applicants will check for suitable PNPs and apply for the nomination. They can create the Express Entry profile when the province or territory they applied to agrees for a nomination. There they can show that they have the provincial nomination.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Non- Express Entry System<\/strong>:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Non-Express Entry System is a paper-based application. The applicants will have to select a suitable province whose eligibility requirements they best meet. They submit the EOI under the non-Entry Express stream. Their application will be assessed based on the point system of the particular territory or province. The selected applicants will receive a nomination letter. Afterward, they must submit a paper application for Permanent Residency (PR) visa to the Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Which PNP is Best in Canada?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All PNP in Canada is great and unique. The best and easiest will depend on the applicants and their areas of expertise. However, here are the best three:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP):<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This program offers numerous tech job opportunities. It consists of categories to easily allow skilled workers, graduates, and business owners to migrate to Canada.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To apply to this program, you must have a minimum CRS score of 400 points and higher. Also, the program offers streams for both French-speaking Skilled Workers and Skilled Trades Stream.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program (SINP):<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This PNP program offers a broad range of occupations. Applicants who have had difficulties under the Express Entry system will find this program much more accessible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To qualify, you have to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Have at most minor, one-year work experience in any jobs in Saskatchewan&#8217;s in-demand occupations<\/li><li>Have completed your education up to post-secondary level<\/li><li>Be proficient in either English or French language<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Nova Scotia Nominee Program (NSNP):<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This program offers various options to entrepreneurs, skilled workers, international graduates, and temporary foreign workers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To qualify to apply, you must have an active Express Entry profile. Also, you must have a job offer from an employer in the province. There&#8217;s another option for candidates who have experience in any of the in-demand occupations in the province. These options are Categories A and B, respectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How Much Does it Cost for PNP Canada?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The cost of the PNP depends on your specific program:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Ontario Immigration Nominee Program (OINP) costs CAD 1500<\/li><li>Saskatchewan Immigration Nominee Program (SINP) costs CAD 350<\/li><li>Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program (MPNP) costs CAD 500<\/li><li>British Columbia Provincial Nominee Program (BCPNP) costs CAD 1150<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Quebec Skilled Workers Program (QSWP) costs $812:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It costs CAD 785 for the primary applicant<\/li><li>CAD 168 for spouse or partner<\/li><li>CAD 168 for dependent child<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to get started with the Canadian Provincial Nominee Program<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Maple Education Canada Inc, has four certified Canadian immigration consultants who have assisted thousands of Nigerans and Non-Nigerians in processing their Canadian immigration applications. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our immigration consultants would work directly with you in presenting the best profile for any of the PNP listed above.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get started <a href=\"https:\/\/mapleeducation.ca\/inquiry-form\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Click Here<\/a> and fill out our inquiry form. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) is an immigration program that allows applicants to live in a specific province, contribute to the province&#8217;s economy and gain permanent residence.
