The province has a natural resource portfolio that consists of natural gas, minerals, coal, oil, and Alberta oil sands. This makes Alberta one of the fastest-growing economies in Canada and a popular destination for newcomers, who come looking for job opportunities through the Alberta Immigrant Nominee Program. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Alberta Immigrant Nominee Program<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Alberta Immigration Nominee Program (AINP) is one of Canada&#8217;s Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs). It is an economic immigration program that allows immigrants Permanent Residence (PR) in Alberta. Usually, these immigrants are foreign workers, students, or entrepreneurs interested in settling in Alberta permanently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program is designed for candidates with the skills, abilities, and experiences to benefit and fill labour shortages in Alberta. Or candidates looking to buy or start a new business in the province.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Alberta government regulates this program in partnership with the <a href=\"https:\/\/mapleeducation.ca\/ircc-launches-six-new-immigration-pathways\/\">IRCC<\/a>. To get nominated, candidates must apply for a nomination to the provincial government. If nominated, then the candidate may apply for PR to the federal government together with their spouse or children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Alberta Immigration Nominee Program (AINP) Streams<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This program offers five streams:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.alberta.ca\/ainp-alberta-opportunity-stream.aspx\">Opportunity stream<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.alberta.ca\/ainp-international-graduate-entrepreneur-immigration-stream.aspx\">International graduate entrepreneur immigration stream<\/a><\/li><li>Express Entry stream<\/li><li>Foreign graduate startup visa stream<\/li><li>Self-employed farmer stream<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Opportunity Stream:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This stream offers an immigration pathway to foreign workers in the province.

Also, they receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for PR.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.alberta.ca\/ainp-foreign-graduate-start-up-visa-stream.aspx\"><strong>Foreign Graduate Start-up Visa Stream (FGSVS)<\/strong><\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This stream is specifically designed for candidates who have completed post-secondary education outside Canada but wish to reside in the province.
