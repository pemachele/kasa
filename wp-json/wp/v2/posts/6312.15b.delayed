Some passports are deemed more powerful than others. However, the strongest passports are the ones that offer the most outstanding travel freedom to travellers. In this article, you will understand the benefits of a Canadian passport.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While choosing travel destinations, travellers mostly consider destinations they can go to, what documents would be required before entry and the cost. Therefore, the world&#8217;s strongest passports are the ones that easily allow travellers into many countries without supplementary entry requirements like the visa.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why the Canadian Passport is One of the Most Powerful<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.henleypassportindex.com\/\">Henley Passport Index<\/a>, a passport is ranked highly if it allows the holders entry into many countries with either of:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Passport<\/li><li>Visa on arrival<\/li><li>Electronic travel authorization (eTA)\/ online visa waiver.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Using this criterion, Canadian passports are ranked in the 5th group of countries along with the United States, the United Kingdom, Malta, Greece, France, Hungary, Czech Republic, and Poland.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Canadian passport is ranked 9th place in the most powerful passports in the world according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.passportindex.org\/\">Guide Passport Ranking Index<\/a>. This means that Canadian passport holders can travel to many world countries visa-free. Out of the existing 195 countries in the world, this <a href=\"https:\/\/visaindex.com\/country\/canada-passport-ranking\/\">report<\/a> shows that a Canadian passport holder can travel to 188 of them without a visa through passport only, a visa on arrival, or via an eTA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to providing free access to over 180 countries in the world, the Canadian passport is one of the most desirable passports in the world. The holders have free visa access and visa on arrival into countries such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The United Kingdom<\/li><li>The United States<\/li><li>United Arab Emirates<\/li><li>Japan<\/li><li>European Union (the entire EU), etc.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>It allows for instant worldwide travel opportunities for its holders.&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When entering Canada, holders of visa-free passports are required to obtain beforehand, an Electronic Travel Authorization. It costs $7CAD and it can be obtained online.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, when flying into a country without visa restrictions, Canadian passport holders will likely be required to show their passports and some other documents such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>International travel insurance<\/li><li>Proof of accommodation<\/li><li>Proof of sufficient financial means<\/li><li>Countries such as Australia and New Zealand will require holders to submit their Electronic Travel Authorization.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of the 188 countries, Canadian passport holders can gain entry without visas, 45 of them will require that you apply for a visa on arrival. The documents that will be required includes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Passport (with at least, 6 months validity and at least, one blank visa page)<\/li><li>A proof showing your willingness to leave the country after your visa expires(a return travel ticket)<\/li><li>Proof of accommodation in your new visiting country (this could be a letter of invitation from a host or a hotel reservation).<\/li><li>You must demonstrate financial capability enough to cover your stay (<a href=\"https:\/\/mapleeducation.ca\/nigeria-student-express-canada\/\">bank statements<\/a>)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, you won&#8217;t necessarily have to show these documents always. The demand for these <a href=\"https:\/\/mapleeducation.ca\/canada-student-visa-application\/\">requirements <\/a>vary by country and for some, your passport and flight ticket is enough.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can I get into any country with a Canadian Passport?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Canadian passport holders are required to obtain visas before they can get into about 41 destinations in the world. Some countries where visas are required for Canadian passport holders include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>India<\/li><li>Turkey<\/li><li>China<\/li><li>Russia, etc.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This <a href=\"https:\/\/visaindex.com\/country\/canada-passport-ranking\/\">report<\/a> shows that there are a total of 138 countries Canadians can visit without a visa, 45 Canada visas on arrival countries, and 5 eTA destinations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, now that you&#8217;ve learned the benefits of a Canadian Passport, what&#8217;s next?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can reach out to us at <a href=\"http:\/\/mapleeducation.ca\">Maple Education Canada<\/a> to help you achieve your dreams of studying, working and living in Canada.
