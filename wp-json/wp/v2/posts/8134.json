This renewable scholarship is offered to international students who are citizens of African countries, who are admitted in the Fall 2022 term (September start date)&nbsp; or later with an admission average of 80% or higher, who are studying in English, and who enroll in one of the specified undergraduate programs in the faculties of Engineering, Science, or Social Sciences. This significant financial contribution to their education reduces their tuition fees by $17,500 &#8211; $25,000 for the excellent scholarships and by $12,000 &#8211; $20,000 for the entrance scholarships, depending on the program annually.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All students who are eligible for this scholarship will automatically receive it upon enrolment. It will be applied directly to their tuition fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Entrance scholarship cannot be combined with the Excellence Scholarship for African Students Studying in English.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our scholarship program is one of the most generous in Canada. It rewards not only your pre-university academic achievements but also your achievements every term of full-time study at University. The new scholarship will give African students studying in English access to numerous pilot programs in three faculties for a significantly reduced cost of tuition.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In a bid to assist students throughout the application process, the University of Ottawa will host a number of virtual sessions to answer questions and guide prospective students on the application process.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All eligible students are considered for this award and will be notified at the time of their admission. Although no application is required for this scholarship, recipients will be asked to submit proof of citizenship of a country of territory in Africa before receiving their first installments.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The application deadline for all 2022 nominations is on or before 1st April 2022.&nbsp;To get started fill out our chat widget and a representative would reach out to you.<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The University of Ottawa has announced millions of scholarships for African students for the 2022\/2023 Academic&nbsp; Year.
